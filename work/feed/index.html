										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Connect the world</h4>
<p>Infobip is one of the world’s leading SaaS companies whose goal is to create seamless mobile interactions between businesses and people. By providing a broad range of solutions, messaging channels, and tools for advanced customer engagement, security, authentication, support, and retention to enterprises, telecoms, developers and SMBs, Infobip connects billions of people every day.</p>

<h4>From product-centric to customer-centric</h4>
<p>As a rapidly growing company that entered a new phase in their business journey, Infobip needed a new website that would better represent who they are and what they offer, and also function as a hub for their lead generation activities. They tasked us with creating a website that would be tailored to their users by stepping away from a product-centric approach and embracing the customer-centric one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Crafting experience one module at a time</h4>
<p>In order to accommodate Infobip’s constant growth, the web itself needed to be immensely scalable and easily customizable. We achieved that by building all of the elements using the principles of atomic design, and connecting them into modules which can be rearranged and connected to form a large number of templates.</p>

<h4>Focus on customization to focus on users</h4>
<p>Infobip’s new website needed to focus on reaching goals related to lead generation, brand positioning and employee attraction, and each goal targeted a specific user group of enterprises, investors, business owners and potential employees. To achieve those goals, we created a custom information architecture which connects those users groups with specific sections on the web through content touchpoints that guide them towards main conversion actions.</p>

<h4>Solution provider &gt; product provider</h4>
<p>To emphasize Infobip&#8217;s customer-centric approach, we focused on positioning the company as a solution provider, rather than a product hub. We did this by creating a style that reflects new trends in the messaging industry and by grouping their products into categories of solutions adapted for specific industries like banking, finance, mobile marketing, retail, customer service and a variety of others.</p>

<h4>Step-by-step lead qualification</h4>
<p>Lead generation is one of Infobip’s core pillars, so we had to modify the process of lead qualification on the web to fit the needs of Infobip’s sales team. We based it on the technique of progressive profiling, and connected to specific content touchpoints. This setup allows Infobip to simplify their sales process by gradually collecting more data on users as they go through the buyer&#8217;s journey, but it also provides a frictionless user experience when it comes to lead generation.</p>

<h4>Complete control over the tool</h4>
<p>As our client’s previous IT service provider went out of business, they tasked us with building a new online app from scratch based on latest technologies and UI/UX tools. It needed to consist of the same core functionalities, but upgraded to provide a better and smoother user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Rethinking the design to enhance user experience</h4>
<p>During a discovery workshop with the client, we’d gone through a detailed research about its users and the way they interact with the tool. This research guided our design proposals, which ultimately led to a complete overhaul of the tool’s design elements &#8211; they are now more intuitive, as well as easier to use and navigate through.</p>

<h4>Superior statistics and data comparison provide added value</h4>
<p>One of the outstanding features of the MARKABLES tool is data comparison which enables users to take multiple reports and stack them together. It is an extremely powerful feature as it enables users to get even deeper insights about specific topics, businesses and industries from them.</p>

<h4>Key pillars &#8211; advanced search and filtering options</h4>
<p>The amount of data and generated reports that are available within the MARKABLES tool is enormous and constantly growing. That is why we focused on creating a set of robust filtering options that users can easily understand and start using, but that are also extremely scalable and can follow the tool’s growth.</p>

<h4>Topping it off with a full web redesign</h4>
<p>As the markables.net website is the main point of contact between the brand and potential customers, we redesigned it to match the visual identity of the tool. By modernizing its visual elements and restructuring the content, we created a simpler flow that provides website visitors with key information and leads them to try the tool.</p>

<h4>Overhauling the fraud detection workflow</h4>
<p>Real-time card fraud management and detection is one of the services MPSI offers its customers, but third-party platforms they used became too limited for their analysts. MPSI tasked us with creating a streamlined fraud management platform that would complement the workflow of their analysts and be tailored to their needs.</p>

<h4>Starting by uncovering needs through workflow research</h4>
<p>Primary users of the fraud management platform are MPSI analysts, so we conducted a series of one-on-one shadowing sessions with them. This enabled us to map out their workflow, and detect pain points that cause the most issues. Insights gathered in this research were used to create a feature list and a production plan for the new tool.</p>

<h4>Simplifying processes without limiting users</h4>
<p>The platform provides MPSI analysts, whose work revolves around handling lots of data, with all of the features they need to perform their job. But it doesn’t lock them into a specific workflow &#8211; it is designed to complement them and enable them to customize the platform around their specific ways of performing daily tasks.</p>

<h4>Providing users with full control over their work</h4>

Simple UI upgrades within these elements helped them streamline their work by allowing them to focus on the most critical pieces of information.</p>

<h4>Maximizing impact by focusing on the small things</h4>
<p>MPSI analysts perform a lot of small actions hundreds of times, so we focused on them to make them simpler, quicker to perform and overall more efficient. For example, analysts constantly copy and paste information, so we modified the UI to make that a single-click, 1-second action, instead of a series of clicks that takes 5 or more seconds.</p>

<h4>Innovative algorithmic trading</h4>
<p>After successfully completing their Initial Coin Offering, Digital Assets Power Play approached us with their whitepaper. They tasked us with a year-long project of creating the core for their crypto trading platform, the DataStreams system that had to analyze market data, find correlations and discover trading opportunities from hundreds of exchanges and thousands of markets in real time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>13 key modules built around Kafka®</h4>
<p>We created the entire Digital Assets Power Play trading platform as 13 advanced modules built to work fully on their own, as well as in a system. All those modules are connected and communicate with each other through Kafka®, a stream-processing software serving as a data-transferring core of the Digital Assets Power Play platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>All-round redundancy</h4>
<p>To make sure the platform performs at peak efficiency and that all information is available to users at a moment’s notice, multiple instances of the same module are deployed into the platform. Some modules are even multiplied within the platform more than 100 times to ensure user and data scalability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Infinitely scalable platform</h4>
<p>Digital Assets Power Play platform needs to support infinite increase in the number of users as well as data sources. That makes vertical scaling and adding additional modules impossible because of the limitations in available hardware’s processing power. By building all modules around Kafka®, we enabled new modules to connect horizontally instead of vertically, and made the platform infinitely scalable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>108 exchanges, 2,921 currencies, 16,923 markets</h4>
<p>The basis of the project was to create a platform that would serve as a single hub for crypto traders with all the information and trading options they need in one place. In order to accomplish that, the Digital Assets Power Play platform was built to gather information from all major exchanges, cryptocurrencies and markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>AI-powered trading</h4>
<p>As the goal of the entire project is to simplify crypto trading for all users, Digital Assets Power Play platform takes advantage of progressive artificial intelligence models. These AI models enable the platform to find correlations within analyzed data and provide users with market predictions.</p>

<h4>No delay, no downtime</h4>
<p>Providing large amounts of real time data to users is a crucial element of algorithmic trading platforms. By building all modules around Kafka® that acts as a central data highway, we enabled the platform to do it with surgical precision and zero downtime, regardless of the data that needs to be collected, analyzed and delivered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>35.3 million data messages per day</h4>
<p>Within the platform, users have access to a variety of advanced trading options and information, such as ticks, L1/L2 order books, candles, technical indicators, indices, sentiment, crypto news and predictive models. All available in real time. When coupled with a large number of data sources, the platform makes approximately 1.6 million database messages per hour which results in 1 terabyte of data transferred per day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Rebuilding the product</h4>
<p>After nearly a decade of trial &amp; error with the digital transformation of their business model, Performance Fact came to us to rethink, design and develop an intensive strategic planning and school improvement system. The system would be used to accelerate student learning through the continuous improvement of strategic planning, teaching, leadership and organizational practices.</p>
<h4></h4>

        <blockquote class="c-quotes__item">
            <p class="u-a4">We’re very pleased with Bornfight’s spectacular work. For the first time, our platform is intuitive and enables users to onboard quickly.</p>

<h4>Immersing into interlaced US education system</h4>
<p>Through a series of workshops, we dove into the complex US educational system and the specific challenges that needed to be solved. By gathering valuable information from the users, we got the insights that needed to be aligned with the stakeholders’ needs.</p>
<h4>Aligning business goals with the online platform</h4>
<p>As we were rebuilding the platform, the whole system needed to be realigned to the core business needs of the Performance Fact. That meant that we needed to get rid of some of the core parts of the existing platform and make more room for new ones. Stakeholder workshops helped us define a clear vision of the future platform and its alignment with the business vision of the company.</p>
<h4>Improving the user experience</h4>
<p>One of the main goals was to significantly improve user experience, and in doing so bring joy to customers using the product. That meant that we needed to fulfill all the needs of different user groups that were using the platform for different purposes. Through user research and interviews, we defined the pain points and needs for every role.</p>
<p>Some of the main principles in user experience improvement were:</p>
<ul>
<li>significant simplification of the tool, based on user needs</li>
<li>building a more intuitive collaboration platform for different roles and participants</li>
<li>easier and more comprehensive data visualization and analysis</li>
<li>focus on employee performance inside school organizations</li>
<li>goals oriented platform for day to day usage in school environment</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Changing the way companies do media intelligence</h4>
<p>Mediatoolkit is a 24/7 media monitoring and analytics tool that gathers information from 100+ million online sources. It notifies users in real time whenever their company, competitors, key people from their organisations or any other keyword they decide to track is mentioned online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

        <blockquote class="c-quotes__item">
            <p class="u-a4">Bornfight understands what does or doesn’t make sense for mobile users, so it’s no surprise that a lot of our users praised the new app’s intuitiveness and ease of use.</p>

<h4>Real-time tracking for on-the-go professionals</h4>
<p>Mediatoolkit’s web tool was upgraded with new functionalities much faster and much more frequently than the mobile version of their tool, so they tasked us with creating a new iOS and Android application from the ground up. One that would enable their customers to use all of Mediatoolkit’s core functionalities on-the-go.</p>
<div style="padding: 55% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/385017942?quality=720p&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<h4>Perfect companion app for a powerful web tool</h4>
<p>The goal of the project was not just to create a copy of the web version for mobile devices, but rather an application that complements the web tool. As Mediatoolkit’s core user group of PR professionals and marketers want to be aware of the communication surrounding their brand at all times, this mobile app enables them to get real-time notifications and keep track of all the news &#8211; even when they&#8217;re away from the computer.</p>

<h4>Defining app features based on users’ core needs</h4>
<p>By working closely with Mediatoolkit’s Customer Success team, we gathered a large amount of data about the behavior of their users and their needs. Detailed analysis of that data enabled us to create a list of functionalities we needed to implement, as well as to define the ways users should move through the application and interact with it.</p>

<h4>Enhancing the experience</h4>
<p>Making sure that the mobile app compliments the experience of using Meditoolkit’s web tool was one of our key objectives. We achieved that by placing a strong emphasis on the overall visual identity that matches the one on the website, as well as by focusing on core actions and elements users interact with the most.</p>

        <blockquote class="c-quotes__item">
            <p class="u-a4">As the application itself displays a large number of information to users, we maxed out on functionality - utilizing native components and giving a clear role to every visual element within the app.</p>

<h4>Allowing users to create their perfect flow</h4>
<p>The mobile application needed to compliment the Mediatoolkit web tool by adapting to different workflows of its users, so we enabled them to customize certain aspects of app itself &#8211; from core actions like setting up keywords and queries, all the way to defining how they’d like to receive notifications or times when the app shouldn’t disturb them.</p>

<h4>Complete focus on app fluidity and intuitiveness</h4>
<p>Mediatoolkit is an extremely powerful tool that offers its users a wide variety of features and options for tracking keywords and mentions. To make it simple and intuitive to use, especially on small mobile screens, we focused on designing a streamlined app architecture that seamlessly guides users through all of its functionalities &#8211; from the initial onboarding to real-time tracking.</p>

<h4>Natively developed for both iOS and Android</h4>
<p>As iOS and Android have different UI patterns, we created a separate mobile app for each operating system. Functionalities and the overall experience Mediatoolkit’s users were accustomed to remained the same &#8211; they were just tailored to each of the platforms and their specific standards. This native development approach made the applications more fluid and increased their performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Mobile application results</h4>
<p>After the launch of the new application for iOS and Android, Mediatoolkit experienced a surge in the number of mobile users.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>25%</strong> of Mediatoolkit&#8217;s monthly active users are using the new mobile application</li>
<li><strong>30%</strong> of all Mediatoolkit&#8217;s paid users have downloaded the new mobile application</li>
</ul>

<h4></h4>
<h4>Vital information at a glance</h4>
<p>Our client used to conduct a majority of their business communication through Facebook groups, but decided to replace them with a custom tool, as a lot of important business information would get lost among their employees’ private feeds. They needed a system that would allow their business managers to easily send important information to all members of the organization and ensure that information gets seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>Communication unbound by borders</h4>
<p>As our client’s company is divided into several regions across 8 countries, we implemented the option to filter out region-specific information. That way, business managers can send posts to all users of the Beyond mobile application, or only members connected to certain regions. This enables even greater granulation of information, and makes sure specific groups of app users see the information they need to see, but it also keeps the entire communication transparent as all users have the ability to check out what’s happening in other regions.</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>Giving a voice to all app users</h4>
<p>To keep the stream of information uncluttered, posts in the feed and push notifications can only be created and sent by a selected number of people within our client’s organization. To prevent one way communication and increase user engagement within the application, we gave all users a way to express themselves. We added the ability to add comments and replies, which turns all posts into mini chats. Because of this feature, all app users can now freely discuss news and voice their opinions, but without adding more clutter to the main feed.</p>

<h4>Like for a job well done</h4>
<p>To give users even more options for personal expression, we introduced custom post reaction.<br />
Besides the standard “like” reaction, we added a special “well done” reaction which employees can use to express their approval and validation on certain news. This helps build a common sense of progress, approval and boosts the feeling of going in the right direction. And it’s also much more personal than a regular “love” reaction.</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>Reaching out, within</h4>
<p>Another specific challenge our client had was structuring all contact information for their employees, since they usually communicate with each other on a daily basis and often between different teams and regions. To help them become more productive and faster in solving problems, we implemented a simple contacts screen that’s searchable by name, title and region.</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>Working together towards the same goal</h4>
<p>For our client, Beyond mobile application became a quick and easy channel of communication that’s accessible to every single employee. It enabled them to connect with each other across the regions and strengthen the feeling of being a part of one large team that’s working together towards the same goal. In addition to that, transparency and a structured two-way communication enabled the members of the management to become closer with their employees, which made everyone more closely connected despite a large number of employees within the company.</p>

<p>Lufthansa is the largest airline in Europe, both in terms of fleet size and the number of passengers. It is also one of the five founding members of Star Alliance, the world&#8217;s largest airline alliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Presenting new long-haul destinations</h4>
<p>As Lufthansa planned to expand its business with seven new long-haul destinations, they tasked us with creating a website concept that would present those new destinations to users in a way that’s different and innovative.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Website as a part of digital presence and rebranding</h4>
<p>Intesa Sanpaolo Card (now Mercury Processing Services International) is a fintech company that was widely considered to be a bank because of its connection to the Sanpaolo banking group.</p>
<p>As they were leaving the group, they got the opportunity to rebrand and show who they really are &#8211; an international technology-oriented B2B company whose business is to provide innovative payment solutions. Their culture is much more similar to startups and modern IT companies than corporations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The assignment</h4>
<p>Rediscover the brand image and build a new website, with three goals in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduce a new brand identity</li>
<li>Present their innovative solutions to clients</li>
<li>Attract potential high-performing employees</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Partnering together through multiple workshops to reach the goal</h4>
<p>To allow the seamless transition of the company’s brand perception, we conducted multiple workshops together with the Mercury marketing team and their stakeholders, where we precisely defined user needs, pain-points, and most importantly, company goals that needed to be addressed through brand perception transition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Creating the digital brand identity</h4>
<p>Since Mercury PSI is a modern company, the website and brand have chosen colors that represent their contemporary spirit. While choosing the color, writing style and showing authenticity of the company through photos, we have been trying to move away from the whimsical, artificial style that represents their competition in the fintech industry.</p>

<h4>A website suited for a dynamic corporate culture</h4>
<p>A dynamic presentation of content was used to emphasize innovation as an important part of the company’s culture. The historic progress of the company and their most important services are shown in the innovative spirit of the company.</p>
<p>People are those who make the company—that was our main principle in creating and organizing information architecture for the “Careers” page. The right type of potential employees is crucial for constant company progress, which is why we worked closely with Mercury’s teams to bring out the personal and human approach to finding the right people fit.</p>

<h4>Showing their expertise and why they are the leaders in their industry</h4>
<p>In the payment business, security is a top priority, and Mercury’s purpose is to continuously provide secure services to their clients and customers. Their expertise is shown through multiple security certificates, but more importantly, we wanted to show that they are a socially responsible company that is environmentally aware.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a leader in their field they share their expertise and organize forums and events. This is why we put a big emphasis on creating a digital space that would cover all the latest trends in the payment business industry. A place for all payment industry professionals to get notified about their events, and find all relevant information and materials as if they had attended the actual event.</span></p>
