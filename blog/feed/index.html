<h3>To see what’s going on under the hood of a trading platform our development team worked on, we sat down with Marko Kruljac, our Senior Developer and Tech Lead.</h3>



<p>Marko was one of the key people involved in the project, so we got him to tell us more about what makes this advanced crypto platform tick.</p>



<h4>OK, when we first talked about this project, you told me that the entire platform has 6 main components.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Yeah, we developed the platform to have 5 main modules all built around the central one &#8211; Apache Kafka that serves as a sort of a core information highway for the entire platform. Those five main modules are:</p>



<ol><li>Kolektorka</li><li>Deduplikator</li><li>Kasirka</li><li>Streamerka</li><li>Arhiverka</li></ol>



<p>In addition to those 5, we also have 8 supporting modules.</p>



<h4>Let’s focus on those 5 main components and Kafka.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Right, right. Now, how can I describe the architecture of the product so you’ll understand it? OK, imagine a large conveyor belt. And there are boxes being placed on the belt &#8211; and as they travel across they are processed and analyzed, and when they come to the end, you get a finished product.</p>



<p>The first element in this entire process, the one that places the boxes on the conveyor belt is Kolektorka. This module collects information about executed trades and about the state of the order book. These two pieces of information are crucial for the entire platform because we use them to calculate all elements that need to be presented to users. Currently, there are between 120 to 140 Kolektorka modules active inside the platform and they are collecting information from more than 100 crypto exchanges.</p>



<h4>So how do they work?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Basically, we started off with 1 Kolektorka and gave it a list of exchanges it needs to visit and told it what data it needs to ask those exchanges for. When it gets the needed data, it puts it on the conveyor belt (which is Kafka, but we’ll talk about that later).</p>



<p>And that’s generally what this Kolektorka module does. I mean, the entire architecture of the system is built around small, independent, stupid modules doing most of the work, because that’s easy to create, maintain and scale. And Kolektorka is just that &#8211; small, distributed, isolated and stupid.</p>



<h4>When you say stupid…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Stupid means it does only one thing, but it does it extremely well. I say stupid, but maybe the better term would be extremely specialised. You see, there is no special logic behind a module like that. I mean, everything Kolektorka does can be explained in one sentence &#8211; go to the exchange, gather data and send them to Kafka.</p>



<p>It has a defined list of exchanges it needs to visit and exact crypto pairs it needs to gather the data on. We mostly want to collect data on all available pairs from all available exchanges, because the more the better. The more data you have, the more competitive edge you have &#8211; that’s why we want it all.</p>



<p>So yeah, Kolektorka is pretty straightforward &#8211; it gets a task to go to, for example, Bitstamp and collect data on the BTC/USD pair. It knows how to get to Bitstamp and how to ask for the data it needs. You see, exchanges won’t give you data for all pairs at once, so you have to get them one by one. If you need the data about trades, you’ll get the info on all trades executed from the last time you asked for it. If you need the data about the state of the order book, this gets a bit more complicated because the order book can be extremely large, but in general, you just need the top 10 to 20 percent for analysis.</p>



<p>OK, so now you got the info. The thing is, this is all extremely slow because you have hundreds of exchanges and thousands of crypto pairs. If you have just 1 Kolektorka, there’s a way to get data on specific pairs from multiple exchanges at the same time because they don’t communicate with each other, but there’s no way to get data on all pairs from a single exchange because every exchange limits the number of times you can ping their API. They put the limit to secure themselves from DDOS attacks, and it basically means you have to wait anywhere between 2 to 5 seconds between requesting data again.</p>



<p>As I said, that’s extremely slow because we need data in real time. In the initial phases, we solved that problem by brute force. We didn’t have 1 Kolektorka, but 100 with different IP addresses. And one will ask for BTC/USD from exchange A, the other for BTC/EUR from exchange A and so on and so on until we cover all the pairs.</p>



<h4>And when you have 100 Kolektorka modules…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Exactly, you get 100 pieces of data in an instant. Instead of using 1 Kolektorka and waiting 200 seconds to get all the pieces of data you need, with 100 Kolektorka modules you get it all in 1 second.</p>



<p>As I said, when we started, this was the way to solve the problem with exchanges limiting the number of requests we could send, but it all changed some 6 month after we started.</p>



<h4>What happened?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, more and more exchanges started supporting socket technology and they basically said &#8211; don’t ping us every couple of seconds, just connect to our exchange using sockets and we’ll send you the data when any change occurs.</p>



<p>When we started, we had a Kolektorka module constantly sending requests to the exchange &#8211; give me the data, give me the data, give me the data. And most of the time it got the same answer &#8211; nothing changed, nothing changed, nothing changed. That wasted resources for both us and the exchanges. Now, with sockets, you don’t have to constantly send requests and ping exchanges, because they send you the info you need at the exact moment something happens.</p>



<h4>I’m sensing a ‘but’ here…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> But… it wasn’t so simple. You see, we had to reprogram the modules to support that. The initial ones were all Rest Kolektorka modules and they were super simple to develop because you had a complete library you could use &#8211; it was plug and play, and it worked perfectly. When we wanted to turn them into Socket Kolektorka modules, we had to code them from scratch for every single exchange.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5701" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Let me guess, every exchange has something special and different, which makes the process extremely difficult?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Exactly! None of them work like you’d expect. They are all special in their own nasty way, and that made our job so much harder. I mean, there were situations where there was absolutely no documentation on how to connect to them using sockets and even less on getting them to send you the data you need. But we did it &#8211; developed it from scratch for all the exchanges that supported it.</p>



<h4>So what does it mean for the system?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, you no longer need to have 100 Kolektorka modules to connect to 100 exchanges because you’re not limited and don’t have to wait. You can have 20 modules beacause each one can easily connect to 5 exchanges and get info from them. And all it has to do is receive data and send to Kafka. This was the ideal solution because we get the data in an instant and we don’t waste resources on constant pinging.</p>



<h4>OK, but then why do we still have 100 Kolektorka modules in the system?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Backup. We have them for backup, and because not all exchanges support sockets. And the thing is that we want to collect data from all exchanges.</p>



<h4>Got it. Are we done with Kolektorka?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, we just covered the trades. Kolektorka also collects data on order books, and that’s a whole other beast. Size-wise. See, one trade is about 15 kilobytes, while an order book has hundreds of orders on the left side and hundreds on the right. And you have to collect them all, for all crypto pairs and from all exchanges. That’s more than 15,000 unique markets.</p>



<h4>And that’s all Kolektorka’s job?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Exactly. It needs to continuously collect order books, but that’s not 15 kilobytes, it’s more like 200. And that can fill up the available space pretty fast. But the thing with order books is that, although they’re large, they change rarely. For example, if you view it at T=0 and then T=0+0,5 seconds &#8211; only a couple of top rows have changed. Everything else remained the same.</p>



<p>This is where we did an awesome little thing to optimize everything &#8211; instead of sending the entire order book to Kafka every single time, Kolektorka sends it just the first time and identifies it as an original. And then just sends the data that’s different from that original &#8211; basically patching the order book every time it receives new data. And the best thing is that each of these patches is 5 kilobytes.</p>



<p>By doing that we compressed the data, saved terabytes of space every week and made everything work even smoother. And that’s that when it comes to Kolektorka.</p>



<h4>Nice, onto the next one!</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> OK, the next element on our conveyor belt is the Deduplikator.<br>You see, Kolektorka modules are redundant &#8211; there are 4 to 5 of them that collect the same things at the same time. Now I know what you’re gonna ask &#8211; why do you need 5 copies of the same data? Well, what if one Kolektorka dies, what if its IP gets banned, what if there’s a power outage &#8211; whatever it may be, you still have other sources active. The data must go on. Get it.</p>



<p>As great as that is, it also leaves us with a ton of duplicate data. That’s where Deduplikator comes into play. Just as I said about Kolektorka, it’s also a stupid module. Its task is to be a gatekeeper &#8211; to only let the new data pass through, while blocking duplicates.</p>



<h4>OK, how does it work?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, it’s like this. If you want to build your own Google that could browse only one website &#8211; that’s super simple. But if you want to develop one that could browse the entire internet, well that’s a multi-billion dollar project.<br>Creating a Deduplikator module that would remove duplicates from one exchange &#8211; piece of cake. Develop one that would deduplicate terabytes of data…</p>



<h4>Mission impossible…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Let’s just say that you need a really, really smart solution to do something like that. And we managed to find that solution in Redis.</p>



<p>It’s a database whose main feature is that it’s extremely fast because it doesn’t save data on the disk, but on RAM. And it’s a crucial element of deduplication. The Deduplikator module reads the info about a trade and lets it pass, and then goes to Redis and says something like: “Hey there Redis, i just let this trade go through under this key (the key consists of the exchange name, exact crypto pair and the ID of the trade). If the trade with this same key comes again, remind me that I’ve already let it through because I can’t remember that stuff.”</p>



<p>As I said, Deduplikator is also a stupid module &#8211; it does only one thing extremely well and can’t do anything else. Deduplikator can let data go through and inform Redis about the key, but it can’t know what exactly it let through. And that works perfectly.</p>



<p>Now, there’s a little caveat &#8211; there’s 50 gigabytes of data on Redis, which means you need 100 gigabytes of RAM to make it work. And RAM can be expensive if you plan on storing all that data. That’s why we decided to optimize the whole thing and said OK Redis, you need periodically delete all data that’s older than 1 week if we want this to be stable. And like I already said a couple of times &#8211; this also works perfectly.</p>



<p>Here’s what we’re thinking &#8211; if it’s been more than a week, nobody’s going to collect that data again, and there will be nothing to deduplicate. It’s old news. I mean, we could collect data from the last three years, but if you know you’ll never get duplicate data, you don’t need it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-scaled.jpg?x22406" alt="Software developer working on a laptop - Bornfight Custom Software Development" class="wp-image-5104" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<h4>But that’s just the trades…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Right, that was the easy part. Deduplicating order books was a hell of a job. Deduplicating trades is simple because you have a key &#8211; exchange, pair, trade ID. If it’s new, let it pass. If it matches, throw it out.</p>



<p>But order books, oh boy. You have 100 Kolektorka modules that see the same or just slightly different order book, and they all pass that information at the same time. And now your job is to figure out the timeline and rebuild the order book. You need to figure out what’s the truth, and what that order book really looks like &#8211; and only 1 way is the correct one.</p>



<h4>Now wait a minute, how come Kolektorka modules don’t have the exact time when a piece of data was collected?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> They do, but it’s the job of a Deduplikator module to take them all together and put them in the correct order. You see, sometimes delivery can be a little late, and when you receive hundreds of pieces of data every second, being a little late can mess up the system.</p>



<h4>OK, so how did you solve it?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, Redis did most of the heavy lifting. But the thing is that you can never have it fully correct. There’s always that fraction of a percent that might be wrong and you have to live with it. But it’s easy to live with it because that fraction of a percent…</p>



<h4>It’s practically irrelevant in a couple of seconds because of the sheer amount of data that the system collects.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Exactly, spot on. Basically, the Deduplikator module get all those snapshots of different parts of the order book, takes them all together and recreates one uniform information that it sends through. It’s extremely complicated, but it works. You got rid of duplicates, you solved the problem with the disk and you solved the problem of having to do the same thing over and over and over again. And this leads us to our next big module.</p>



<h4>Kasirka?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Now that we have all that data, we have to do something smart with it. And we are, although the module that does it is again very stupid, or extremely specialized as we said before.</p>



<p>Kasirka is a module that does technical trade analysis &#8211; that’s a set of mathematical functions and formulas that, when coupled with trade information, give you metrics, and additional data that can help you with creating trading strategies. One of the most basic examples of this would be a simple moving average &#8211; a graph showing the price through time. This was just an example, Kasirka does a wide variety of simple and much more complex analysis.</p>



<p>The great thing about developing this was that we didn’t have to do it from scratch &#8211; there’s a full library we could just connect and implement &#8211; it’s called TA-Lib, technical analysis library. It’s written in C, which means it’s extremely fast, and it’s basically a black box. We can, for example, say that we need an RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator &#8211; we input the data, TA-Lib does its magic, we get the numbers we need and send them through our conveyor belt. This library makes it as simple as that.</p>



<p>Now let’s get into a little bit more detail. Kasirka is not one module, it’s basically three &#8211; there’s a Candle Maker Kasirka, Technical Analysis Kasirka and Index Kasirka. The first one on our conveyor belt is the Candle Maker kasirka &#8211; it just receives trade data and aggregates them in 10 different time intervals, starting with 1 minute. It aggregates, it makes its calculations and then it sends the data to Kafka. That’s all it does, and that’s extremely important because its output is the input that Technical Analysis Kasirka and Index Kasirka need to perform their tasks.</p>



<p>The great thing about the Kasirka module is that it’s fully scalable. Let’s say you have 100 pairs you need to analyze &#8211; if you have 1 Kasirka it will analyze all of the pairs. If you have 2 Kasirka modules, they’ll organize themselves through kafka and each one will analyze 50 pairs. If you have a 100 of them, each will analyze 1 pair. There are no limits, it’s infinitely scalable.</p>



<h4>How many Kasirka modules are currently in the system?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> There are 50 modules and the whole thing works extremely smoothly.</p>



<h4>OK, what’s next?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, I think it’s finally time we tackle that Kafka element we’ve been talking about from the beginning. Kafka is basically the core of that conveyor belt. It’s LinkedIn’s distributed system for communication and delivering messages, and it’s the only component that we didn’t develop from scratch &#8211; we just took the entire solution, configured it, installed it, connected everything, turned it on and it worked like a charm.</p>



<p>The main thing Kafka enabled us to do is scale the entire system. Whenever you need to upgrade the system, you simply add new nodes (they call them Brokers) that can receive and send new messages. You just add a couple of pieces of new hardware and you’re good &#8211; that was benefit #1. The other benefit was that Kafka also enabled us to infinitely scale all our modules &#8211; all because of Kafka’s simple technique called partitioning.</p>



<p>Imagine our conveyor belt divided into three parts, with little barriers between them. Now you don’t have one single person working on the entire belt, but three different people, and each one of them has to take care of the boxes only on their part of the belt. That means you can send three boxes at the same time, and all three will be analyzed at the same time. And this partitioning option isn’t limited to three &#8211; it enables you to divide the conveyor belt and increase the number of modules as much as you need. It was the ideal solution for the system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4728" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter.jpg 2048w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter-1536x768.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></figure>



<h4>It was basically a plug &amp; play solution?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> I’d say plug &amp; pray. You see, none of us worked with Kafka before, so we kind of winged it. We rented a bunch of machines on Amazon Web Services, installed Kafka and tried different things until it worked. You see, although the technology has been around for some time, Kafka just recently gained some traction. This means there are limited resources online, so working with it is basically a trial &amp; error process. And after a lot of that trial &amp; error, we ended with the right solution we implemented into the final platform.</p>



<p>And that’s basically it, that’s Kafka. I mean, I could talk for hours about it, we could make a whole series about that single component…</p>



<h4>But it’s time to cover the final two modules.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Yes, Arhiverka and Streamerka. Let’s start with Arhiverka.<br>What you need to know about our conveyor belt is that it’s flat and that it has an end. And when a box comes to the end, it just hangs on there for some time, until other boxes push it of the ledge. Now, if those boxes aren’t opened, analyzed and stored before they fall of the belt, the data they’re carrying is lost. So if you need some data from three months ago, well tough luck.</p>



<p>But that’s why we have Arhiverka. This module basically archives all of the boxes &#8211; it takes them from the belt, makes an exact copy and saves it in its database. And you need that because you need access to historical data.</p>



<p>So you have the streaming platform which gives you current, real-time data. And you have Historical which shows you how the markets changed through time.</p>



<h4>So, for how long is it stored?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> How long? Indefinitely. It’s cold storage.</p>



<h4>That’s a whole lot of data…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Yeah, that’s a whole lot of data. Last I checked, there were 700 million database inputs. And that’s some. Give me a quick second to crunch the numbers… That’s some 13 gigabytes per minute. I eyeballed it, it’s a napkin calculation. I could be wrong, but I think this is more or less somewhere around the correct number.</p>



<p>So yeah, it’s a whole lot of data. Enormous, just enormous amount of data being collected every day. And when you know that each piece of data is just a couple of kilobytes, the entire thing is even more amazing. While we were testing the platform during the development, we filled 5 terabytes in about 2 weeks.</p>



<h4>Damn, that’s… I don’t even know what to say. While I wrap my head around this, tell me more about the last module.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Ah yes, Streamerka. Amazing module.<br>Streamerka is actually data streaming as a service, and its task is to be the interface for customers. This is the module that enables them to connect to the system and to receive data about crypto pairs from exchanges.</p>



<p>By using Streamerka, users can subscribe to get information about trades, order books, technical indicators, candles, indexes. Users can even subscribe to get news and sentiment &#8211; they can see whether the crypto community has positive or negative feeling about certain cryptocurrencies. For example, users may want to get information about all pairs available on Bitstamp, or maybe they just want to get info about BTC/USD, but from all exchanges. Due to the amount of raw data the system collects from more than 100 exchanges, the possibilities to get personalized information and analyses are endless.</p>



<p>The entire system is, of course, built on socket technology, so users don’t have to constantly ping the system. They just need to subscribe to the information they want to receive and the system delivers it to them in real time. They just need to have an active subscription.</p>



<p>And I believe that’s it. We covered them all &#8211; Kafka as the main central highway, the conveyor belt of our story, and 5 key modules that collect, analyze and distribute data.</p>

<h3>Discovery workshops have been a core aspect of our process for years because they proved to have numerous benefits both for our clients and for us. But since our clients have their HQs in different parts of the world, we often need to replace in-person discovery workshops with remote ones. Here’s how we do it!</h3>



<p>A discovery workshop is a part of our initial project definition and planning phase, and its goal is to fully define the scope of the project and goals that need to be achieved, but also to set expectations for all sides involved in the project.</p>



<p><strong>It is extremely beneficial because it:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Can reduce the overall production costs</li><li>Leads to an increased production speed</li><li>Helps minimize the occurrence of risks and issues during production</li><li>Enables clients to meet the team that will be working on their project</li><li>Results in a precise production roadmap for the entire project</li></ol>



<p>Although the overall concept and <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/product-discovery-workshop-top-5-benefits-for-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits</a> are the same, organizing and running a remote discovery workshop is a bit different than conducting a ‘regular’ in-person workshop. There are new tools you have to use, you need to establish some specific rules, prepare a different type of agenda… and on top of that, you still need to ensure everyone is fully involved, engaged and active behind the webcam.</p>



<p>This can sound like quite a bit of extra work, but it’s actually fairly simple if you take into account a few of these pieces of advice we gathered over the years of conducting in-person discovery workshops and remote discovery workshops. So let’s get started!</p>



<h4>#1 Prepare in advance</h4>



<p>Having a “we’ll figure it on-the-fly” mentality is not something we advise when it comes to organizing and conducting discovery workshops. While we’re all for “wingin’ it” from time to time, and sure, some activities can be performed with that approach, remote discovery workshops are not one of them. To make sure everything goes smoothly and according to the plan, preparation is the key.</p>



<p><strong>And this preparation covers everything:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Having a clear structure of the workshop and preparing the agenda in advance, so it can be sent to all of the participants</li><li>Preparing all of the assets that’ll be used or needed — this includes all the templates, tools, documents, prototypes… anything that could be useful during the workshop</li><li>Double checking all of the tools to make sure they’re working as they&#8217;re supposed to — there’s nothing more demotivating than starting the workshop with an hour long troubleshooting session</li><li>Onboarding all of the participants — telling them what they’ll go through, what to prepare for the workshop, how will they communicate, what are the rules and guidelines, showing them all of the tools that’ll be used…</li></ol>



<p><strong>Checking off all of these activities will ensure that the workshop itself goes as smoothly and as efficiently as possible.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5893" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02.jpg 1200w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h4>#2 Get off the tool hype-train</h4>



<p>When it comes to conducting remote discovery workshops, tools are an absolute necessity, but tools can also be an enormous distraction if you go overboard with them. The key here is to only use the tools that enable you to do more activities better and faster, and that ultimately help you go through the workshop in the most efficient way possible. Using tools as a crutch in an effort to minimize the lack of preparation or clear agenda or any other aspect is exactly what you need to avoid.</p>



<p><strong>In our remote discovery workshops, we keep the tools to a minimum:</strong></p>



<ol><li><strong>For conferencing and communication, we use either Google Meet or Zoom<br></strong>Either option is fine as they both have similar features — they work without issues or lag, you can turn on the webcam and turn off the mic, they enable participants to share their screens and they have the option to record the meeting. You don’t need much more than that for a conferencing tool, so the choice between one or the other is just personal preference.</li><li><strong>As a virtual whiteboard, we use Miro<br></strong>Whiteboards are a key element of every discovery workshop, and Miro is just that — a clean and easy to use whiteboard and visual collaboration tool that can be shared with all of the participants. It has all of the necessary features you’ll need, but it also comes with a bunch of pre-configured whiteboard templates which make the initial setup much simpler and faster.</li><li><strong>For prototyping during the workshop, we use Figma<br></strong>Figma is amazing because it enables us to quickly create visual prototypes of the elements we talked about during the workshop. Because of its advanced collaboration functionalities, it enables multiple people to work on the prototype, get feedback, iterate and improve.</li><li><strong>For storing and sharing documents, we use Google Drive</strong><br>When it comes to storing and sharing files, there are numerous options, but Drive is the gold standard. It’s simple, it has all of the features you need and it just plain works.</li></ol>



<p><strong>And that’s it, those are all of the tools we use. And we honestly very rarely feel the need to add another one.</strong></p>



<h4>#3 Limit the number of participants and set clear roles</h4>



<p>When conducting remote discovery workshops, it’s always a good idea to limit the number of participants in order to keep an energetic and productive workflow during the entire workshop. We found that having 4 to 6 people is ideal, and 7 is the upper limit. Within those 4 to 6 people, it’s important that we have at least one decision-maker from our client’s side, while we always involve a set of specialists who will be involved on the project.</p>



<p>Making sure everyone is active and engaged is a bit difficult when you’re just seeing them through the screen, so keeping the number of participants lower will ensure that the optimal level of workflow and the discussion can be maintained at all times.</p>



<p>In addition to limiting the number of participants, we also set specific roles for members within our team — we define who’ll be leading and facilitating the workshop, who’ll be keeping the notes, etc.</p>



<p><strong>By doing that, every person participating in the workshop knows what they’re expected to do, and that ultimately leads to a much more productive environment that is fully focused on the goal.</strong></p>



<h4>#4 Establish a basic set of rules</h4>



<p>Creating a set of rules that should be followed during the course of a remote workshop is necessary in order to keep the focus of everyone involved on the elements that are actually important.</p>



<p><strong>The thing is, participating in a workshop while you’re on a laptop is a distraction waiting to happen, so it’s always a good idea to define a couple of dos and don’ts like:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Turn off the phones to avoid getting distractions</li><li>Postpone answering an email until the first break</li><li>Try not to speak while others are speaking</li><li>Try to keep your webcam on</li><li>Be on time after the break</li></ol>



<p><strong>Simple rules and guidelines like these minimize the distractions and put everyone into the proper working mode for the duration of the workshop.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5527" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>#5 Create a detailed agenda</h4>



<p>Having an agenda beforehand and sharing it with all of the participants is very important, but what’s even more important is structuring it in a way that enables everyone to know exactly what will be discussed during each of the time slots. This is really helpful when it comes to planning for day 2, day 3, day 4… of the workshop.</p>



<p>Here’s what an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yNOz2AFQpkhj0WBzM_ZP-GYW-GJRhm3caKY3uJyi-K4/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example of an agenda</a> for a remote discovery workshop looks like when we’re sending it to our clients. You can see all of the time slots and their main topics, as well as specific elements within those topics that will be covered during the specified time slots.</p>



<p>In addition to creating detailed agendas, with remote workshops we also like to turn the overall daily workload down a notch, so our ‘regular’ 2-day workshops usually turn into remote 3-day workshops with a day off between each workshop day.</p>



<p><strong>Maintaining focus and being fully active and engaged for 8 hours is practically impossible when you’re in front of a screen, so this setup proved to be ideal.</strong></p>



<h4>#6 Use off days to reflect and reorganize</h4>



<p>As we said in the previous section, when we conduct remote discovery workshops, we always have a day off between every workshop day. For example, if we’re conducting a 3-day workshop with a client, Monday, Wednesday and Friday are workshop days, while Tuesday and Thursday are off days.</p>



<p>We organize it that way because we use those off days to reflect on what we’ve done during the previous day and to prepare for the next. Off days are when we analyze all of the decisions, when we work on prototypes and create a specific plan of what we’ll go over the following day. This is also the day when our clients can prepare additional info we might need or go over the aspects we covered during the workshop with their teams.</p>



<p><strong>This setup has proven to be much more effective than having a three day, back to back to back workshop.</strong></p>



<h4>#7 Emphasise engagement</h4>



<p>Making sure that all of the participants are active and engaged during the workshop is essential for its success, and that is even more important when the workshop is conducted via a video conferencing tool. The thing is, participating in a workshop while you’re alone in front of a computer screen just isn’t as stimulating as being in a room full of other people — pair that with a conversation that is sometimes laggy, devoid of side conversations, gestures, body language… and that high-energy workshop experience gets really toned down and that can lead to decreases engagement.</p>



<p>That is why we have strategically organized tasks and breaks during our workshop days, and why facilitators who lead our remote discovery workshops with clients are always keeping a close eye on the overall dynamics, speed and energy of the discussion.</p>



<p><strong>When those levels start decreasing, that means it’s time to pull people back into the conversation with a new question or a topic.</strong></p>

<h3>A lot of people consider Quality Assurance to be just software testing, but there is far more to benefit from the QA. </h3>



<p>We could rather say that Quality Assurance is a structured process that raises the quality of a product to a higher level, all while keeping in mind the client&#8217;s requirements and the end users’ needs. This process ensures that a certain standard of quality is set on the project from the very beginning and that it is accepted by all members of the project team. </p>



<p><strong>Also, having a QA process on the project can be very motivating for the whole team, especially for the developers who get to have an extra layer of security.</strong></p>



<p>On the other hand, you should know that the QA process is not completely bug-proof and it doesn&#8217;t aim to eliminate 100% of the bugs in the system — that would be a Sisyphean task. There will always be a few bugs that do not overly affect the system as a whole. The QA makes sure that the system works by the criteria which are acceptable for the end users. Nevertheless, it is important that everyone on the project understands and agrees on what the acceptable level of bugs might be. For example, the team agrees that the application will be available and used only on iPads, so if you are going to try it on your iPhone, you will surely find a whole bunch of bugs — at the minimum due to resolution differences.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would like to have a QA professional during the whole development process and in every cycle, which is more of an agile approach — in a process like this, bugs can be discovered and fixed early, before moving to another development cycle. This can benefit your project because the time needed to launch the solution that&#8217;s being developed is shortened, and also because enables you to stay within the set timeframes and your budget.</p>



<p>Searching for bugs and fixing them at the end of a project can be very challenging as you can discover and fix some bugs which can lead to breaking some other features, which again leads to new bugs and so on. But even that is much better than putting your software, app or website to use without a proper QA check.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_software_testing_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-3253" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_software_testing_body01.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_software_testing_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_software_testing_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_software_testing_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></figure>



<h4>Better late than sorry</h4>



<p>Let me give you an example that will tell you a bit more about the importance of QA.</p>



<h5>#1 Is it worth investing QA budget in something “more” important?</h5>



<p>Consider a situation where a product, let’s say a webshop, is launched without a proper QA check. Management wanted to invest more money in promotions because a big shopping weekend was in the near future, so they decided not to go with QA. Suddenly, a whole bunch of customers started using the web shop — but then, after some time, customer complaints about not getting their merchandise started coming, so they had to hire extra people in their customer service department.</p>



<h5>#2 What was the cause?</h5>



<p>It was later found that when the webshop is overloaded, the merchandise and their sizes were not synchronizing in real-time but with some delay. This delay was enough to let 2-3 customers order and pay for the same product, which led to some customers not getting their orders.</p>



<h5>#3 How much did it affect their business?</h5>



<p>In the best case scenario, this bug is is discovered and fixed within a couple of days. If you think that the cost of a couple of development hours can correct this mistake and get them back on track, let me give you some more context. </p>



<p>There are a lot more expenses than just development hours — handling a bunch of customer complaints, money refunds, failed promotions, damaged brand and the most expensive one, angry and unsatisfied customers. Because of it, company management will have to invest a lot more money in order to get the customers to trust them again when it comes to shopping on their site. And on the other side, the unsatisfied customers would now rather go and buy from the competitor&#8217;s webshop — it could be more expensive, but at least they can be sure they will receive the items they bought.</p>



<h5>#4 What should have been done?</h5>



<p>Competitor&#8217;s webshop was smart enough and trusted their QA professionals — they made proper performance testing which led them to discover that the system may cause some delays when a lot of customers are buying at the same time. As soon as they discovered this anomaly, the development department dealt with it and the site safely went live.</p>



<p><strong>In this example, I showed you that QA is not a luxury, it is a necessity. It can save your business reputation, morale of your teams and valuable customers.</strong></p>

<h4>2 main types of software testing</h4>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk a little bit more about different types of software testing, what are they good for and how do they compare.</p>



<h5>#1 Manual testing</h5>



<p>Manual testing is a type of testing performed by a tester who has good attention to details. It requires the tester to be able to see the product from a user’s point of view and to search for the potential defects in it. Manual testing is very important when it comes to cognitive and behavioral testing — it focuses on exploring the product and its behavior, as well as user experience, whether all elements are visible and the overall usability of the product. </p>



<p>At the end of the manual testing process, the tester prepares a detailed bug report for developers which should contain the name and the description of the bug, steps needed to reproduce the bug, expected and actual behavior, screenshots, videos, severity and priority recommendations, as well as some additional comments or tips if there are any.</p>



<h5>#2 Automated testing</h5>



<p>Automated testing, on the other hand, is where the tester uses scripts, code or automation tools to get the testing report. It is very useful when you need to repeat the same test many times with the same or different data sets — you can run your automated tests or have them running automatically any time you want. This process helps you find out if some bugs are repetitive or if some part of the system broke down after the integration with some new features or because some modifications were made to it. </p>



<p>In automated testing, the lack of human interaction can be both a pro and a con. Its pro is reliability because these tests are run by a computer with given inputs and expected results, so there is not much room for human error. On the other hand, without human interaction, it is hard to check the visual parts of the system and its behavior from the user&#8217;s perspective.</p>



<h5>Manual vs Automated testing</h5>



<p>Manual and automated tests are completely different kinds of QA testing and there should never be a question of should you use only one or the other. In order to have a desired quality of the app, web or software, an important thing is to find the right balance between these two — that is the task of QA professionals.</p>



<h4>What is a good QA team?</h4>



<p>Really good QA professionals are enthusiastic about quality, they have a deep knowledge of testing techniques and they tend to find bugs that anyone on the project would overlook. However, it can be expensive and hard to find a good QA professional, let alone a whole team. </p>



<p>If you don’t have a QA on your project team, you can always outsource them and integrate them on the whole project or just to do a checkup before putting a product on the market. This is an easy and effective way to achieve high quality of your product.</p>



<blockquote class="c-quotes__item">
    <p class="u-a4">Quality in a service or a product is not what you put into it. It is what the client or customer gets out of it.</p>
    <div class="c-quotes__info">
        <p class="u-b5">Peter Drucker</p>
        <p class="u-b6"></p>
    </div>
</blockquote>

<h3>In the last 2 years, 90% of the world’s data has been created and businesses are spending more than $180 billion a year on big data analysis.</h3>



<p>Even though the numbers are high, there are still companies that don’t use this as an opportunity to start investing in Big Data. If you are one of them &#8211; take a look at how some of the big guys are doing it and how it’s giving them an advantage on the market.</p>



<h4>But before we start &#8211; what exactly is Big Data?</h4>



<p><strong>(and how is it different from “small” data)</strong></p>



<p>The term Big Data has been around for some time now, but it has taken a whole new meaning today when people share 500 terabytes of data per day just on Facebook. And on YouTube, there are over 300 hours of video shared every minute!</p>



<p><strong>Based on those facts, we can say that users are constantly offering their data to companies. But why do companies need so much data?</strong></p>



<p>Data can help them with many things, but most importantly, it can help them identify new business opportunities which can generate more sales and create a better customer experience. It also makes decision-making faster and solving problems more efficient.</p>



<p><strong>As for the difference between Big Data and the rest of data &#8211; it lies within the 5 Vs.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Volume</li><li>Velocity</li><li>Variety</li><li>Veracity</li><li>Value</li></ul>



<p><strong>When it comes to volume, the word itself says it all, Big Data is exactly that &#8211; big.<br></strong>When we talk about velocity, we talk about how fast we can gather the data we need &#8211; it is incredibly important to have real-time data at any time to make better business decisions faster.</p>



<p><strong>Once we’ve accumulated data, we need to understand the different types of data there are (variety).</strong></p>



<h5>When we talk about Big Data, we talk about its three forms:</h5>



<ul><li><strong>Structured <br></strong>Which is easy to store and analyze, and which can be created by a machine or by humans (accounts for up to 20% of all of the collected data).<br>Examples: address details, numerical ratings by customers, demographic information…</li><li><strong>Unstructured</strong><br>It’s more difficult to analyze and search for and, even though it accounts for a much larger percentage, people usually disregarded it &#8211; until AI was able to make it easier to process.<br>Examples: photos, videos, audio, social media content, open-ended surveys…</li><li><strong>Semi-structured</strong><br>This is a mix of structured and unstructured data. It includes parts that can be easily organized, but it also includes data that is hard for a machine to sort out.<br>Example: an email message — unstructured data is the text within the email, while structured data includes the name of the recipient, time sent, email address of the sender…</li></ul>



<p>Once you have the data, it needs to pass a credibility and quality test (Veracity), and last but not least the data needs to be useful for your business &#8211; it needs to give you information that will provide some benefits to your business (Value).</p>



<p><strong>Now that you know the traditional explanation of what Big Data really is, the best way to actually understand it is to see how it works in real life. Let’s take a look at how some of the world’s largest brands made Big Data a part of their core business.</strong></p>



<h4>Amazon</h4>



<p>Amazon is definitely the number 1 e-commerce shop at the moment and they have their database to thank for that. They are constantly using big data to improve their customer experience, so here are two examples that show just how well that works.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5958" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h5>Dynamic pricing</h5>



<p>Everybody knows that airlines use this tactic when selling plane tickets &#8211; if you check out the same tickets over and over again, it probably means you really want them and are willing to pay more for them. That same logic is implemented on Amazon’s website. But what you probably didn’t know is that they change their prices up to 2,5 million times a day.</p>



<p><strong>What affects these price changes are factors like shopping patterns, competitor’s prices, and whether the product is a common one or not.</strong></p>



<h5>Product recommendations</h5>



<p>It doesn’t matter if the person buys the products, puts it in the cart or even just takes a look at it &#8211; Amazon will use that data. That way they can learn what each customer wants and likes, and can recommend that same product or similar ones to them when they return to the shop.</p>



<p><strong>This is how the company earns 35% of their annual sales.</strong></p>



<h4>The Marriott hotels</h4>



<p>Hospitality industry has been growing in the last few years and will definitely continue to grow. The Marriott hotels, one of the biggest hotel chains in the world, are one of the leaders in the industry, so let’s take a look at how they use Big Data to generate more revenue and gain more loyal customers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5959" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>Just like Amazon, Starwood hotels (one of the brands under Marriott hotels) also use dynamic pricing. It is changing based on a variety of factors such as local and global economic situation, weather, availability and reservation behavior, cancellations and many others &#8211; this tactic resulted in a 5% revenue increase per room.</p>



<p><strong>They go so deep with utilizing data that they even follow if famous musicians are playing at the Madison Square Garden so they could adjust their rates at their nearby hotels.</strong></p>



<p>To create a better customer experience, they also started testing out facial recognition check-ins which looks like a win-win scenario &#8211; their guests don’t need to wait at the reception desk anymore, and the hotel gathers even more valuable information. Another element they implemented to gather data is putting Amazon Echos into the rooms &#8211; this allows guests to make Alexa handle everything that was previously handled by the reception staff. Now guests can get all the information they want, while Marriott gets the knowledge of their customer’s preferences, needs and potential concerns.</p>



<h4>Netflix</h4>



<p>Netflix is unarguably the biggest online platform for streaming movies and TV shows, and it owes its success to Big Data. Because they know their users, their retention rate is 93% which, compared to their main competitors, is a huge number. They are also growing rapidly because of their original movies and TV shows that just show that they actually listen to their consumers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5960" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>And because of that, this year they were able to compete with traditional giants and win two Golden Globes and two Oscars. And it looks like this is just the beginning!</p>



<p><strong>So, how do they use their data to create such a good customer experience?<br></strong>They collect data such as the time during which their subscribers watch the show, if they binge-watched it or it took them some time to finish, did they pause the show and if they resumed it after pausing…</p>



<p><strong>And all of this is used to create personalized accounts for each consumer!</strong></p>



<p>Their goal is the ultimate personalization and that is clearly shown through their plans for the future which include using AI to create trailers &#8211; because why should everybody get the same one. They plan on creating trailers that are fully personalized for their viewers &#8211; for example, if a specific user loves romance movies, they are more likely to watch a non-romance movie if the trailer is filled with romantic scenes. And that is just the tip of their plan.</p>



<p>Netflix will be able to achieve this through machine learning, and even though machines still can’t understand human emotions, it is something we can expect in the near future. And when it comes to the bottom line &#8211; this will greatly reduce the cost and time needed to create the trailer and put Netflix on the right path to achieve their goal of ultimate personalization.</p>



<h4>Uber Eats</h4>



<p>For a couple of years, Uber has been the leader in the taxi business and nobody was surprised when they announced they will be expanding their services &#8211; from driving people to delivering food.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5961" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p><strong>They entered this saturated market of food delivery and, thanks to the data they collected from being a taxi giant, they are here to stay.</strong></p>



<p>They wanted to be recognized as a delivery that always brings food while it is still warm, so they tried to model the physical world in a way that would allow them to be as accurate as possible when predicting the time of food delivery. To make this endeavor work, they also collected the data of how much time it usually takes to prepare a certain meal, so they could pinpoint the exact time when the delivery person should come and pick it up.</p>



<p>This action allows the drivers to pick up more meals on their way (as they don’t have to wait for the food to be prepared) and Uber is encouraging them to carry more than one meal per trip with a bonus for each meal they collect.</p>



<p>This, however, is not something that has never been done before, but by using data, they are doing it better than anyone before. I mena, they are going deep with this that they even employed meteorologists to help them predict what the weather will be like and how it will affect the delivery.</p>



<p><strong>What Uber Eats is doing is a textbook example of how Big Data and data analysis can help businesses expand their services and give them a clear advantage over their competitors.</strong></p>



<h4>McDonald’s</h4>



<p>The food industry and trends are always changing, and if you want to be able to stay at the top, you need to be able to change with them. And that is exactly what McDonald&#8217;s is doing. With the rise of the trend of healthy living and using online ordering, fast food restaurants were faced with a problem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5965" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p><strong>That is when McDonald’s started to turn to the data they collected over the years. They wanted to transition from mass marketing to mass customization &#8211; in order to do such a thing, they needed to unlock the data in a way that is useful to customers.</strong></p>



<p>What they came up with was a drive-thru with digital menus that change based on a variety of factors &#8211; from the time of the day, to weather, and to historical sales data. That way they can offer their clients a cold beverage on a hot day or maybe a coffee with their breakfast menu.</p>



<h4>Starbucks</h4>



<p>Starbucks is a global brand with a famous logo and the infamous activity of writing wrong names of their customers on cups. As I previously mentioned, personalization is the key to growth nowadays, and that is exactly what Starbucks is doing &#8211; they are using Big Data to create a better customer experience!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5962" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p><strong>The way they collect data is by providing their customers with Starbucks rewards programs and mobile apps which help them learn more about the buying habits of each of their customers.</strong></p>



<p>Starbucks is then using that data to recommend products to their loyal customers, create better marketing campaigns and new menus, as well as decide where they’ll open their next store. This system is so organized that it will offer their customers products based on the season, weather and location they are at.</p>



<p>They also send out personalized emails with offers to customers who haven’t visited the store in a while, so they can re-engage them or send them discounts.</p>



<h4>Accuweather</h4>



<p>All the companies mentioned above use their data internally, but can big data you have be turned into a service? Well, Accuweather did just that.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5963" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>In the past, their partners were exclusively global brands, but they realized that many other businesses could benefit from their weather data as well. That is why they created an online platform for developers where they could purchase API keys and implement it in their own projects/businesses.</p>



<h4>What can you pick up from this article?</h4>



<p>Sure, not every trend is worth jumping on, but big data is no longer just a trend. This is a proven thing that works if you truly want to be able to understand your clients and transition your business to the next level.</p>



<p>Today, in order to generate more sales, you need to be able to really listen to your consumers and treasure all the data they provide you with. And with the advancements in machine learning, even smaller companies can use Big Data to improve their businesses.</p>



<p>However, with all the previously mentioned elements getting easier and more available, the influx of data sources and ways to analyze and present data has made the process of defining the right business strategy around big data that more difficult &#8211; but that is the topic for the whole new article.</p>

<h3>Subscription-based strategy is like a free trial mode as it enables users to download and try the application for free, but then requires a subscription to bypass feature or content restrictions.</h3>



<p>__________<br>If you have an app and you’re looking for a way to monetize it, our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bornfight.com/resources/business-models-for-mobile-app-monetization/" target="_blank">free ebook</a> can help you choose the right monetization model.<br>__________</p>



<p>Even though the paid subscription business model is the most common app revenue model, subscription-based mobile apps, including Netflix, Spotify, Tinder, Dropbox and Deezer have gained huge popularity in the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Mobile apps have become an integral part of everyone’s lives today, whether it’s in the area of shopping, booking, lifestyle or service in any kind. People rather prefer to book most services with mobile apps than via phone call or an email, so creating an app became a smart move for numerous companies and businesses around the world. It saves time and makes the whole process easier and more enjoyable for users.</p>



<h4>What is a subscription based app monetization model?</h4>



<p>Subscription model is similar to in-app purchases as it enables users to buy additional goods, content and features. But instead of giving them the option to buy whenever they wish, subscription model introduces ‘subscription periods’. When users have an active subscription, they can use the app’s premium aspects, and when that subscription expires, users can no longer use them &#8211; unless they subscribe again. With the subscription model, users are able to use a feature or consume content for a predetermined amount of time called a subscription period. It can be a monthly subscription or an annual one. And when that period passes, they are prompted to extend their subscription in order to get continued access to those premium features or additional content.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4679" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h5>2 main modes of subscriptions:</h5>



<ol><li><strong>Non-renewing subscriptions<br></strong>Users pay for one subscription period, and when this period ends, users are prompted to choose whether they want to buy another subscription.</li><li><strong>Automatically renewing subscriptions<br></strong>Users pay for the subscription and it automatically renews after each subscription period comes to an end.</li></ol>



<p><br>Subscription model is quickly becoming one of the top monetization options due to the fact that users get to try the application for free and that subscriptions can bring in steady recurring revenue. And in addition to that, application owners pay less transactional fees to Apple and Google for long-term subscriptions &#8211; 15%, as opposed to other models that have a strict 30% fee.</p>



<p><strong>The key to achieving success with the subscription model lies in providing users with a constant stream of fresh and valuable content and services.</strong></p>



<h5>PROS OF THE MODEL</h5>



<ul><li>Provides you with recurring revenue</li><li>Subscribers are usually loyal app users</li><li>Significantly increases app engagement</li><li>Users keep subscribing as long as they keep getting value from the app</li><li>Can attract a large number of users with a free version of the app</li><li>You can still monetize your non-subscribed users with ads</li></ul>



<h5><br>CONS OF THE MODEL</h5>



<ul><li>Can be hard to determine what to put in the free version and what behind a paywall</li><li>Paying users have extremely high expectations</li><li>Needs to be constantly updated with new, relevant and valuable content</li><li>Limits families from sharing the same app across multiple accounts and devices</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4676" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>How to make your app worth spending for your users?</h4>



<p>If you have decided to develop a subscription-based mobile app, you need to ensure that your app includes unique features and provides useful content that is worth spending for your users. There are many free versions available that are somehow similar to your app, but how to stand out and make your features with spending money?</p>



<ul><li><strong>You should be aware of your users’ needs and constantly work on improving their experience. <br></strong>Analyzing their interests and behavior can help you get to know them and learn what type of content and features can keep them interested &#8211; content is behind the conversions. It is vital that your content in a subscription model is way better than the one you offer in the free trial.</li><li><strong>Providing users with personalization helps with keeping them happy and satisfied with your app. <br></strong>You should also send notifications and emails when you launch your app updates as it will connect with their specific interests.</li><li><strong>Converting free trial users of your app to subscribers by offering discount offers on your subscription model can also be a great way of gaining subscribers. </strong><br>If they liked the app during the free trial, there is a great chance that they would go for the subscription &#8211; just focus on the users whose free trial is ending shortly and target them with an offer they can’t refuse.</li><li><strong>You should limit the trial version of your app to just one device per user, so you can save the strategy of syncing multiple devices for subscribers. </strong><br>That way, you can make users switch from trial to a subscription model by paying a monthly or an annual fee.</li><li><strong>Do the research on your users and their spending habits. <br></strong>If you have users from the 18-25 age group, be aware that they can’t afford the same amount of money for the subscription as the ones that are 28 or 35 years old. It’s not that much about the willingness, it’s about the possibilities and the income of your target group.</li><li><strong>Define your market wisely and find out as much as you can about your competitors. <br></strong>Analyze what makes their apps stand out and find their weak spots &#8211; they are those key elements that can make their subscribers switch to your app.</li></ul>

<h3>In an ideal world, you could create a mobile application, launch it and immediately start earning money. Since the current app ecosystem isn’t an ideal world, you need a monetization strategy to take care of the money aspect.</h3>



<p>__________<br>If you have an app and you’re looking for a way to monetize it, our <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/resources/business-models-for-mobile-app-monetization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free ebook</a> can help you choose the right monetization model.<br>__________</p>



<h4>What exactly is app monetization?</h4>



<p>The short answer would be the process of leveraging an application’s user base and converting their actions and engagement into a stream of revenue. A more detailed answer would be that monetization is a specific framework that defines the exact ways in which a mobile application drives revenue and generates return on investment (ROI) &#8211; a framework that enables you to answer these questions:</p>



<ol><li>What source of income am I pursuing with the application?</li><li>What value will I be providing and at what price?</li></ol>



<p>Mobile app monetization is a way for you to earn income from your mobile application &#8211; it enables you to take luck and chance out of the picture, and take control of the aspects that affect the success of your application on the market.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5773" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>Do you need a monetization strategy?</h4>



<p>Even if you have an already existing app or you are just starting, you absolutely need a monetization strategy. You need to be able to understand how to generate money from your mobile application that would be most beneficial for your business, but also your users.</p>



<p><strong>But before you choose the monetization model for your app, here are a few steps you need to take in order to create an optimal monetization strategy.</strong></p>



<h5>#01 Consider the type of mobile app you want to create</h5>



<p>Some monetization models only work with specific types of applications, so you need to keep that in mind while you’re defining your strategy. For example, if you want your app to be premium, it needs to be superior to free alternatives, but if you’ll offer to your users the same quality app as the one from your free competitors, then maybe premium is not the way to go.</p>



<h5>#02 Understand your target persona</h5>



<p>This is a tale as old as time &#8211; but you need to know who you are making the app for.<br>If you want your product to be successful on the market, you need to know who is it for, how those customers will use it, what will make them buy it and what they want to get out of it.</p>



<h5>#03 Answers the question: ‘why would anyone buy my app’</h5>



<p>If your app is to be successful, it needs to provide users with something original, valuable or better than what the competition is currently offering &#8211; define that.</p>



<h5>#04 Define what else would your users be willing to pay for</h5>



<p>To make the income you earn grow together with your application’s user base, you need to define specific elements within the app that could be monetized. For instance, you could offer your app for free, but within the app add elements that need to be paid in order to have a better experience.</p>



<h5>#05 See what your competition is doing</h5>



<p>Researching the market you are about to enter is extremely important. And the only way to do it is by taking a look at how your competition is doing. Explore their product, their business strategies, the way they do sales, how they speak to customers &#8211; try to define what they are doing good and what they are doing bad.</p>



<h5>#06 Provide value to your users</h5>



<p>A line between providing value while maximizing revenue and being named a cash grab is thin &#8211; make sure you’re always on the right side of that line because user trust is difficult to get back. Especially now when they have many options to choose from.</p>



<h5>#07 Define your goals with the app</h5>



<p>Define your goals with the app the same way you would define goals for any other business plan. By defining specific goals you want to achieve with your mobile application, you’ll always have a guide that will keep you on the right track and help you make decisions.</p>



<h5>#08 Be in it for the long run</h5>



<p>Establishing a relationship with users is a process that takes time, but users’ engagement with the application is directly connected to revenue, so it’s worth it.</p>



<h5>#09 Don’t sacrifice user experience</h5>



<p>When choosing the right monetization model, great user experience should be one of your top priorities &#8211; great user experience means users will be more likely to spend money.</p>



<h5>#10 Keep your eye on monetization trends</h5>



<p>With more than 204 billion app downloads in 2019, monetization app trends are always changing. To be relevant, keep an eye on Google and Apple as they are major players in the app space, and their actions can have a big effect on the entire app ecosystem.</p>



<h5>#11 Don’t try to reinvent the wheel</h5>



<p>The app market is filled with examples of apps successfully using various monetization models and strategies &#8211; use those insights to your advantage.</p>



<h5>#12 Test, get feedback, iterate, repeat</h5>



<p>Just because you defined a monetization strategy that fits your app and your users, that doesn’t mean you’re done with it. Keep developing and upgrading it based on your users’ behavior.</p>

<h3>Understanding how to monetize your mobile application is a crucial aspect of app development, as it will help you earn revenue while you’re satisfying your users’ needs and providing them with great user experience.</h3>



<p>__________<br>If you have an app and you’re looking for a way to monetize it, our <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/resources/business-models-for-mobile-app-monetization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free ebook</a> can help you choose the right monetization model.<br>__________</p>

You need to build a <strong>sustainable mobile business</strong>, and the creation of a detailed strategy that will enable your application to grow and <strong>bring income to your business</strong> is a very important step when monetizing your app. If you’re looking for a way to do it, these are the models you want to explore.</p>



<h4>#01 Premium apps</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5769" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This monetization model is pretty straightforward &#8211; if people want to use your app they must first <strong>purchase it from the app store</strong>. Once they pay for your application, they get complete access to all of its features.</p>



<p>When the app markets just started, this was the only available monetization model. Today, successfully using this model can be quite difficult as the <strong>competition from free apps is extremely high</strong> and newer monetization models are proving to be more user-friendly, as well as more lucrative for businesses.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for top of the line B2B apps that provide clear business values, as well as apps with unique features and niche audiences looking for very specific solutions.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>Users are rarely ready to buy an application they haven’t had a chance to try out first, so consider providing them with a lite version that has an implemented free trial period. After they’ve had some time to really test out the app and its features, users will have a much larger</p>



<h4>#02 In-app advertising</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5770" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In-app advertising is a monetization model in which app owners <strong>earn revenue for showing third-party ads</strong> within their mobile applications. Without this model, a lot of apps wouldn’t even exist.</p>



<p>This is one of the most popular revenue models because it can be used in almost any application. Mobile apps that use this monetization model are usually completely free for users, and app owners focus on <strong>earning their revenue from advertisers</strong>. In-app advertising model is universal, as it can be used on almost all types of mobile apps and it works for as long as an application has active users.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for all types of free apps that have the potential to be used frequently and for long periods of time.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>Although it may sound like a good idea to put as many ads as you can into your application, the truth is that you always have to put user experience first. If a specific ad type or ad frequency within the app has a negative effect on user experience, users will be less likely to use the app.</p>



<h4>#03 Freemium apps</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5771" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The word “freemium” is a combination of the words “free” and “premium”, and it perfectly explains what this monetization model exactly is &#8211; free meaning users have <strong>access to the basic functionality</strong> and premium including additional features, goods, content and other options not available in the free version.</p>



<p>Freemium is one of the more complex app monetization models as it consists of <strong>two equally important aspects</strong>. A large portion of the app’s functionalities are completely free to use (and the app itself is free to download), but if users want to unlock additional features and options, they need to pay for them.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that provide a continuous value for users &#8211; ones with a great free version and a premium version that provides unquestionable benefits.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>In order for the freemium model to work, the free version of your app needs to find the sweet spot between providing users with too many or too few features. If features in the free version of the app are too good, users won’t have the incentive to buy the full version. On the other hand, if they aren’t good enough, users won’t think the full version of the app is worth the money.</p>



<h4>#04 In-app purchases</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5772" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Despite the fact that only 5% of users make in-app purchases, revenue earned from this small percentage is almost 20 times higher than revenue earned from all the other users.</p>



<p>In-app purchases are <strong>one of the most widely used app monetization models</strong> &#8211; it revolves around the application being free, but enabling users to purchase various types of digital goods. Those goods can take many forms &#8211; from additional app features, in-game currency and power-ups to additional content, new levels, customization options and anything in between. A key component of this model is that the <strong>free aspect of the app must be fully functional</strong> &#8211; in-app purchases should serve only as enhancements to the user experience.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for games and service-based apps that are engaging enough even if users don’t spend money, as in-app purchases are used to improve the experience.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>Users like the idea of using a free application and having the option to spend money if they feel like it. You just need to make sure that every in-app purchase you incorporate into your app provides real value and boosts the overall user experience. Otherwise, your app might fall into a cash grab category and users really dislike cash grabs.</p>



<h4>#05 Subscriptions</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5773" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This strategy is like a free trial mode as it enables users to download and try the application for free, but then <strong>require a subscription</strong> to bypass feature or content restrictions.</p>



<p>Subscription model is similar to in-app purchases as it <strong>enables users to buy additional goods, content and features</strong>. But instead of giving them the option to buy whenever they wish, subscription model introduces ‘subscription periods’. When users have an active subscription, they can use app’s premium aspects, and when that subscription expires, users can no longer use them &#8211; unless they subscribe again.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that have top-quality features, are primarily service-oriented or very content-centric, and whose overall concept encourages frequent and<br>repeated usage.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>Steady, reliable revenue and the overall financial predictability of this monetization model have made both Google and Apple double down in their efforts to make subscriptions the primary monetization model. They have even decreased their commission from 30% to 15% when it comes to all subscription renewals after the first year.</p>



<h4>#06 eCommerce apps</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5774" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This model is also straightforward – <strong>your application is a marketplace</strong> through which you sell physical goods.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the eCommerce model focuses on building a mobile application that serves as your <strong>digital storefront</strong>. And more and more brands are turning to this model due to higher profit margins and the fact that app stores don’t charge a commission for selling physical goods through an app (as opposed to virtual goods that are sold as in-app purchases, and are subject to a 30% fee).</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps whose primary focus is selling physical goods to specific audiences.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>If you want to maximize user engagement, you need to leverage push notifications. As users are more likely to see a notification than open an email, you can incite them to buy more by creating a push notification strategy and sending offers specifically tailored to their needs.</p>



<h4>#07 White labeling</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5775" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you created a mobile application with unique functionality or one that solves a specific problem, you can <strong>monetize it by reskinning it for other brands</strong> or licensing your code to other companies.</p>



<p>A white label product is a term that means you are creating a product that another company can buy from you, rebrand it and sell as their own. It is a <strong>great option for earning additional revenue</strong> from that application without affecting your customers’ experience by implementing some other monetization models.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that are built on unique concepts that can be applied to multiple brands. It is also great for pulling additional revenue from apps that are at the end of their lifecycle and have stopped being profitable on their own.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>In addition to earning revenue by reskinning and reselling your entire application to other brands, you can also resell your mobile application’s code. This will enable other companies to use your application’s code as a framework that will enable them to build their own applications on it.</p>



<h4>#08 Data licencing</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5776" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If your mobile application has a large number of active users, you can start <strong>collecting information on their behavior</strong> and sell anonymous data to third parties like advertisers and analytics companies.</p>



<p>App owners have been collecting user data for ages &#8211; it showed them how their applications are being used and what aspects should they improve. But, prices that companies are willing to pay for user data are constantly rising, so a lot of app owners want to leverage that situation and <strong>generate additional app revenue</strong>. The more daily active users an app has, the more precise, relevant and valuable that data is for data collectors.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that have an extremely large and engaged user base, and can generate a significant amount of data on client preferences or habits.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>If you decide to focus on data licencing as your primary model of monetization, make sure to be mindful of different privacy laws connected to the action of selling customer data you’ve connected through the application.</p>



<h4>#09 Sponsorships</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5777" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Sponsorship revolves around brands and agencies paying to have an exclusive spot within your app. With this model, <strong>brands provide relevant rewards to your customers</strong> when they perform specific in-app activities, and you earn money by taking a share of the revenue from redeemed rewards.</p>



<p>This model is among the newest addition to app monetization as app owners looked for a way to <strong>gain revenue from advertising</strong>, but without decreasing the application’s user experience by incorporating traditional banner ads. By directly partnering with specific brands, you can not only control the type of promotional content that will be displayed within your application and make sure that it is relevant to your target group, you can also create brand activations that are more creative, engaging and interesting to your users. And that can ultimately lead to increased user loyalty.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that want to provide their users with customized experiences and can partner with a brand that has a similar user base so all their activities feel like native elements of the app.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>For the sponsorship model to be effective and provide you with revenue, your mobile application’s user base needs to be either large enough or niche enough to attract brands that will want to pay to get additional exposure through the application.</p>



<h4>#10 Indirect monetization</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5778" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This monetization model is quite different from the others as it doesn’t provide direct financial benefits through the app itself. It revolves around creating a custom mobile application that takes your business models, <strong>digitizes them and provides you value</strong> by making your business more streamlined, efficient, profitable or just better overall.</p>



<p>With more and more companies embracing digital technologies as one of the primary ways to upgrade their businesses and speed up past their competition, demand for high-quality custom mobile applications that can turn traditional business processes into technologically advanced agile solutions is constantly on the rise. To have the most effect on your business, <strong>mobile applications need to be tailored to fully fit your needs</strong>. In order to do so, they can be implemented with a wide variety of customized features.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for companies that want to digitize their business processes and have decided to leverage the benefits of mobile technology in order to do so.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>If you create a mobile application to streamline, simplify or upgrade business processes within your company, try to see if your application could be turned into a Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) platform, and earn even more revenue by licencing it (or smaller, less feature-packed parts of it) to other companies.</p>



<h4>Want to learn more about mobile app monetization?</h4>



<p>Besides these specific monetization models, there are also hybrid models of app monetization. A hybrid model is a combination of two or more monetization models that complement each other to provide your users with more choice when it comes to using the application, and you with more opportunities to earn income.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>Web apps have come a long way since their initial appearance. We all now know just how powerful JavaScript on the web is, and how many endless possibilities exist in terms of framework and technology choices. </h3>



<p>Different frameworks have their pros and cons, but some core methodologies can be applied to almost every framework. Tools such as create-react-app, next.js, vue-cli, etc., are really helpful for bootstrapping a project and its structure, but after that, you&#8217;re free to form an application to your preferences and project&#8217;s requirements.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve collected some principles I found valuable when building web applications with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vue</strong> that can help you in defining a direction and keeping things tidy and sound. Most of the principles can be applied to all software, but this list is a bit specific to web apps.</p>



<h4>1 — Developing components, not screens </h4>



<ul><li>try to encapsulate all the logic of a component in isolation, so it can be rendered everywhere with ease &#8211; for example, in different screens and sections</li><li>all the CRUD operations go inside the <strong>controllers / providers</strong> for the data it needs, and that data is passed to <strong>presentational</strong> components<ul><li>one common scenario is redux/vuex — data is persisted to a store and is treated as a single source of truth, and container components extract the relevant data</li></ul></li></ul>



<h4>2 — Separating presentational and business / controller layer</h4>



<ul><li>not all components need to be connected to stores, backend API or some other service</li><li>by making components &#8220;data source agnostic&#8221;, reusability is greatly increased </li></ul>



<h4>3 — Using a standardized way of fetching the data </h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="rest-hooks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://resthooks.io/" target="_blank">rest-hooks</a> is a great example of this principle as it encourages a predictable and readable structure for API calls</li><li>for some projects, using explicit <strong>fetch</strong> calls may be sufficient, but if you&#8217;re dealing with a lot of resources and relationships, having an abstraction over backend API can be helpful</li></ul>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5748" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body02-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>4 — Having a common user input strategy </h4>



<ul><li>forms, select tags, validations, error states all fall into this category</li><li>UI component libraries such as <a href="https://ant.design/components/form/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="antd (opens in a new tab)">antd</a> provide a solution for this out of the box</li><li>if you&#8217;re creating an app without a UI library, consider putting a bit more emphasis on standardizing these elements for better UX</li></ul>



<h4>5 — Writing automated tests </h4>



<ul><li>components are, in my experience, best tested with integration tests, specifically with <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Cypress (opens in a new tab)">Cypress</a></li><li>business logic should be thoroughly covered with unit tests</li><li>e2e are valuable for smoke testing larger user flows; they can help detect regressions between the client and the API</li></ul>



<h4>6 — Using storybook for creating reusable components </h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="storybook.js.org  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank">storybook.js.org</a></li><li>great way to collaborate with designers and discuss functionality</li><li>serves as a &#8220;living style guide&#8221; for your app</li></ul>



<h4>7 — Using linters and formatters</h4>



<ul><li>examples of linters — ESLint, stylelint</li><li>most bootstrap tools, such as create-react-app, pre-install linters for you, but if you&#8217;re on a legacy codebase, they might not be applied</li><li>they can help you catch bugs, but they can also be used in defining code style for your team — this can help in reducing mental load when developing upon a feature that you&#8217;ve inherited from your colleague</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="sonarJS eslint plugin (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/SonarSource/eslint-plugin-sonarjs" target="_blank">sonarJS eslint plugin</a> can help improve code quality as it checks for logical structure</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="prettier (opens in a new tab)" href="https://prettier.io/" target="_blank">prettier</a> is an awesome code formatter that you set up only once, and never think about it again — very useful when working in a team</li></ul>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5749" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_ruk_scalable_projects_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>8 — Avoiding global styles</h4>



<ul><li>overrides and resets can be made global</li><li>CSS modules or CSS-in-JS are some of the technologies that can help in achieving scoped, isolated styles</li><li>local styles can often lead to better component reusability</li></ul>



<h4>9 — Using structured version control </h4>



<ul><li>using a branching model<ul><li>e.g. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="gitflow (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank">gitflow</a> — a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen</li><li>having a structure in your version control is indispensable for working in a team, but it is helpful even when working on your own</li></ul></li><li>linting commit messages &#8211; <a href="https://commitlint.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">commitlint</a><ul><li>useful in creating a changelog and finding bugs as the project develops</li><li><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="angular's commit message rules (opens in a new tab)">angular&#8217;s commit message rules</a> are often applicable to any software project, and commitlint can help you in keeping those messages consistent with the ruleset</li></ul></li></ul>



<h4>10 — Keeping a changelog</h4>



<ul><li>at the beginning of every project, it&#8217;s usually easy to keep track of all the changes in your mental context</li><li>as the project grows, the changelog can serve as a central place for discovering notable changes to a codebase, even months and years into development</li></ul>



<h4>The never-ending list</h4>



<p>That&#8217;s all folks — there could surely be many more items added to the list, depending on the project domain and technology, but I find these can improve many frontend apps radically. Almost all of the principles can be applied progressively and by priority defined by you and your team — so no need to worry about applying them all at once.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>According to research, social media apps are the most used types of mobile apps, and weather apps are second. But the most interesting part is that banking apps came out as #3 on that list.</h3>



<p>Mobile banking became a standard service in the banking sector, whether it’s used for personal accounts or businesses. There are over 57 million mobile banking users in the U.S., and over 86% of U.S. banks are offering bill payments via banking apps. Providing users with <strong>total control of their financial assets</strong>, anytime and from every part of the world brought the <strong>banking experience to a completely new level</strong>. There’s no need to wait in long queues with a bunch of papers and documents to open a banking account &#8211; now we can get that with just a few clicks on any mobile device. It’s fast, easy, painless and <strong>in the palm of our hands</strong>. </p>



<p>Banking consumers are seeking an experience that is sophisticated, simple and personalized, so they can <strong>feel valued and important</strong> without live face-to-face conversations. For native mobile consumers, design, functionality, and experience can be deciding factors when they’re choosing the app that a bank or a credit union offers. Both <strong>the look and the feel of a banking app</strong> have a strong value. </p>



<p>In this blog, I gathered some of the leading banking apps and neobanks with mobile apps in the U.S. and Europe, so let&#8217;s find out <strong>how these apps stand out with their features</strong>, especially today when almost every bank has its own mobile banking app.</p>



<h4>Advanced 3D Secure Technology with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="N26 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://n26.com/" target="_blank">N26</a></h4>



<p>Every once in a while, everyone probably finds themselves digging around their pockets, old purses and jackets from the last season, looking for hidden treasures and a gold bar laying somewhere under the carpet. But we all know that’s very unlikely to happen. With <strong>N26 Spaces</strong>, there’s no need to keep those rainy day savings under the pillows. It is a tool that allows its users to <strong>set aside money and place it in a sub-account</strong> alongside their main account. Users can create as many spaces as they like and save money for birthdays, parties and long-planned trips. This way, avoiding the temptation to spend that money is easier because it&#8217;s separate from the main account, and if you can’t see it &#8211; you can’t spend it.<br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rejvsITkYQI?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>This German neobank enables its customers to open a free account directly from their smartphones, and they already have more than <strong>5 million users in over 26 countries worldwide</strong>. There are no hidden costs or foreign exchange fees, which can be very <strong>useful for travelers</strong>. N26 also implemented fingerprint identification and <strong>advanced 3D Secure technology</strong> to make its users feel extra safe and secured while purchasing &#8211; whether in-store or online. It’s also possible to have 5 free withdrawals per month and it’s easy to <strong>manage expenses</strong> as AI is used to present detailed insights into account statistics and users’ financial habits. </p>



<h4>Environmental Protection Initiatives for <a href="https://www.bunq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bunq (opens in a new tab)">Bunq</a> Users</h4>



<p>We can all agree that it should be easy for people to make a positive impact on the environment. To make that possible, <strong>Bunq</strong> recently launched its <strong>eco-friendly ‘Green Card’</strong> &#8211; a metallic card whose holders contribute to environmental preservation by having trees planted for every €100 that they spend on it. Every time the system confirms the payment, they <strong>donate a tree</strong> to the partners at Eden Reforestation Projects. All the money that is spent goes directly to provide a fair wage to local workers and plant trees in Madagascar, Nepal, Haiti, Indonesia, Mozambique and Kenya &#8211; to help heal the lungs of our planet. With this feature, Bunq unlocked a completely <strong>new set of users</strong> that are focused on the environment and reforestation. Also, they gained an <strong>eco-friendly image</strong> that is not so common in the banking sector, which made this feature one of a kind.<br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5MGm1jm8n4?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>Besides that, Bunq mobile bank offers its clients <strong>special sub-accounts for everyday budgeting</strong>. One for groceries, one for shopping, holidays or anything else they want. Each sub-account is a full bank account <strong>with its own IBAN</strong>, allowing customers to budget their direct debits, external payments and card transactions very easily. Bunq charges €0.99 per withdrawal and it’s connected with Transferwise for simple and fast money transfers.</p>



<h4>Invest in cryptocurrencies with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Revolut (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.revolut.com/" target="_blank">Revolut</a></h4>



<p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Ripple, Litecoin, Aave, Kleros… it’s hard to keep up with all the cryptocurrencies these days. Since 2009 and the first thought of Bitcoin, there were hundreds of articles prematurely declaring the end of it and doubting it could even survive till the end of the year. But, it did, and according to numerous researches, it became the <strong>top-performing asset</strong> of the decade &#8211; creating a completely new set of users for the banking sector. Since the release of Bitcoin, over <strong>6,000 altcoins</strong> (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) have been created. </p>



<p>In the fintech world, Revolut stepped up the game by presenting its users with the possibility to <strong>invest in 5 different cryptocurrencies</strong>. Any user can instantly exchange any of its 30 currencies directly into Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and XRP with just a few clicks on the phone. Also, cryptocurrencies can be sent easily to any other Revolut account.<br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMuRxmkly8A?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>Revolut Ltd is a financial technology company and a neobank. In addition to a prepaid Revolut debit card, their services include <strong>fee-free currency exchange</strong>, commission-free stock trading and cryptocurrency exchanges.

<h4>Saving Money with <a href="https://www.chime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Chime (opens in a new tab)">Chime</a></h4>



<p>From time to time, saving money can feel like an uphill battle. Let’s take Vanessa as an example. Just when she thought she saved enough for that long-planned trip to Bali, her old minivan decided to break down and, poof &#8211; Bali fund just turned into New car fund. To help people like Vanessa think less about money, but saving more &#8211; Chime app can <strong>automatically take 10% of the paycheck each month</strong> and deposit that amount in the savings account. When Chime customers turn on <strong>Automatic Savings</strong>, each time their debit card is used to make a purchase, the bank rounds up the transaction amount to the nearest dollar. Then it transfers the round-up from the Spending Account to the Savings Account &#8211; the more they use their Chime Visa Debit Card, the more money is saved automatically. <br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_BVJjHfLEs?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>This mobile-only bank has <strong>no minimum balance, no overdraft, and no monthly service fees</strong> &#8211; and Chime users can withdraw their money from over 38,000 ATMs for free. Another special benefit is that any user can <strong>access their paychecks 2 days earlier</strong> with Chime Direct Deposit. </p>



<h4>No IBAN? No problem &#8211; use <a href="https://www.kekspay.hr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="KEKS Pay (opens in a new tab)">KEKS Pay</a> </h4>



<p>In a situation when collecting money from numerous people is necessary, KEKS Pay comes as a life-saver. Planning vacations, parties, buying presents &#8211; everything is much easier with this app. KEKS Pay enables its users to <strong>collect funds through a chat group</strong>, so buying birthday gifts and planning trips seems like a piece of cake. App users just add their friends in a group, send an invitation for the transaction to the whole chat, and in a few clicks all the money is collected and the plan is saved. <br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9EuLim0YjeM?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>

However, app users doesn&#8217;t need to be Erste&#8217;s customers to use this app. <strong>Any bank customer can install it for free</strong> and use it to send or request funds without needing to enter anyone&#8217;s account number, and it’s completely free &#8211; there are no hidden fees.

<h4>How to find out what your users want?</h4>



<p>It may seem hard to create a perfect application to fit your consumers’ needs, but there are a <strong>few important factors</strong> banks should consider:</p>



<ul><li>For users interested in saving their money, some apps have <strong>budgeting and savings tools</strong> that help them keep track of spendings and manage their savings </li><li>For travelers, it is good to have a debit card <strong>they can use wherever they go</strong> &#8211; that way there’s no worry whether a card will be declined while buying souvenirs for their family and friends, or running short on cash because no ATMs want to accept it </li><li>When choosing between different banking apps, users will take into account the option to <strong>save on fees</strong> such as card replacement, overdraught and top-up fees </li><li>And finally, a <strong>combination of high-security standards and rich features</strong> in the application can retain the current bank customers, and also win new ones</li></ul>
