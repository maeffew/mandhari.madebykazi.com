<h3>A lot of people consider Quality Assurance to be just software testing, but there is far more to benefit from the QA. </h3>



<p>We could rather say that Quality Assurance is a structured process that raises the quality of a product to a higher level, all while keeping in mind the client&#8217;s requirements and the end users’ needs. This process ensures that a certain standard of quality is set on the project from the very beginning and that it is accepted by all members of the project team. </p>



<p><strong>Also, having a QA process on the project can be very motivating for the whole team, especially for the developers who get to have an extra layer of security.</strong></p>



<p>On the other hand, you should know that the QA process is not completely bug-proof and it doesn&#8217;t aim to eliminate 100% of the bugs in the system — that would be a Sisyphean task. There will always be a few bugs that do not overly affect the system as a whole. The QA makes sure that the system works by the criteria which are acceptable for the end users. Nevertheless, it is important that everyone on the project understands and agrees on what the acceptable level of bugs might be. For example, the team agrees that the application will be available and used only on iPads, so if you are going to try it on your iPhone, you will surely find a whole bunch of bugs — at the minimum due to resolution differences.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would like to have a QA professional during the whole development process and in every cycle, which is more of an agile approach — in a process like this, bugs can be discovered and fixed early, before moving to another development cycle. This can benefit your project because the time needed to launch the solution that&#8217;s being developed is shortened, and also because enables you to stay within the set timeframes and your budget.</p>



<p>Searching for bugs and fixing them at the end of a project can be very challenging as you can discover and fix some bugs which can lead to breaking some other features, which again leads to new bugs and so on. But even that is much better than putting your software, app or website to use without a proper QA check.</p>

<h4>Better late than sorry</h4>



<p>Let me give you an example that will tell you a bit more about the importance of QA.</p>



<h5>#1 Is it worth investing QA budget in something “more” important?</h5>



<p>Consider a situation where a product, let’s say a webshop, is launched without a proper QA check. Management wanted to invest more money in promotions because a big shopping weekend was in the near future, so they decided not to go with QA. Suddenly, a whole bunch of customers started using the web shop — but then, after some time, customer complaints about not getting their merchandise started coming, so they had to hire extra people in their customer service department.</p>



<h5>#2 What was the cause?</h5>



<p>It was later found that when the webshop is overloaded, the merchandise and their sizes were not synchronizing in real-time but with some delay. This delay was enough to let 2-3 customers order and pay for the same product, which led to some customers not getting their orders.</p>



<h5>#3 How much did it affect their business?</h5>



<p>In the best case scenario, this bug is is discovered and fixed within a couple of days. If you think that the cost of a couple of development hours can correct this mistake and get them back on track, let me give you some more context. </p>



<p>There are a lot more expenses than just development hours — handling a bunch of customer complaints, money refunds, failed promotions, damaged brand and the most expensive one, angry and unsatisfied customers. Because of it, company management will have to invest a lot more money in order to get the customers to trust them again when it comes to shopping on their site. And on the other side, the unsatisfied customers would now rather go and buy from the competitor&#8217;s webshop — it could be more expensive, but at least they can be sure they will receive the items they bought.</p>



<h5>#4 What should have been done?</h5>



<p>Competitor&#8217;s webshop was smart enough and trusted their QA professionals — they made proper performance testing which led them to discover that the system may cause some delays when a lot of customers are buying at the same time. As soon as they discovered this anomaly, the development department dealt with it and the site safely went live.</p>



<p><strong>In this example, I showed you that QA is not a luxury, it is a necessity. It can save your business reputation, morale of your teams and valuable customers.</strong></p>

<h4>2 main types of software testing</h4>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk a little bit more about different types of software testing, what are they good for and how do they compare.</p>



<h5>#1 Manual testing</h5>



<p>Manual testing is a type of testing performed by a tester who has good attention to details. It requires the tester to be able to see the product from a user’s point of view and to search for the potential defects in it. Manual testing is very important when it comes to cognitive and behavioral testing — it focuses on exploring the product and its behavior, as well as user experience, whether all elements are visible and the overall usability of the product. </p>



<p>At the end of the manual testing process, the tester prepares a detailed bug report for developers which should contain the name and the description of the bug, steps needed to reproduce the bug, expected and actual behavior, screenshots, videos, severity and priority recommendations, as well as some additional comments or tips if there are any.</p>



<h5>#2 Automated testing</h5>



<p>Automated testing, on the other hand, is where the tester uses scripts, code or automation tools to get the testing report. It is very useful when you need to repeat the same test many times with the same or different data sets — you can run your automated tests or have them running automatically any time you want. This process helps you find out if some bugs are repetitive or if some part of the system broke down after the integration with some new features or because some modifications were made to it. </p>



<p>In automated testing, the lack of human interaction can be both a pro and a con. Its pro is reliability because these tests are run by a computer with given inputs and expected results, so there is not much room for human error. On the other hand, without human interaction, it is hard to check the visual parts of the system and its behavior from the user&#8217;s perspective.</p>



<h5>Manual vs Automated testing</h5>



<p>Manual and automated tests are completely different kinds of QA testing and there should never be a question of should you use only one or the other. In order to have a desired quality of the app, web or software, an important thing is to find the right balance between these two — that is the task of QA professionals.</p>



<h4>What is a good QA team?</h4>



<p>Really good QA professionals are enthusiastic about quality, they have a deep knowledge of testing techniques and they tend to find bugs that anyone on the project would overlook. However, it can be expensive and hard to find a good QA professional, let alone a whole team. </p>



<p>If you don’t have a QA on your project team, you can always outsource them and integrate them on the whole project or just to do a checkup before putting a product on the market. This is an easy and effective way to achieve high quality of your product.</p>



<blockquote class="c-quotes__item">
    <p class="u-a4">Quality in a service or a product is not what you put into it. It is what the client or customer gets out of it.</p>
    <div class="c-quotes__info">

<h3>Web apps have come a long way since their initial appearance. We all now know just how powerful JavaScript on the web is, and how many endless possibilities exist in terms of framework and technology choices. </h3>



<p>Different frameworks have their pros and cons, but some core methodologies can be applied to almost every framework. Tools such as create-react-app, next.js, vue-cli, etc., are really helpful for bootstrapping a project and its structure, but after that, you&#8217;re free to form an application to your preferences and project&#8217;s requirements.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve collected some principles I found valuable when building web applications with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vue</strong> that can help you in defining a direction and keeping things tidy and sound. Most of the principles can be applied to all software, but this list is a bit specific to web apps.</p>



<h4>1 — Developing components, not screens </h4>



<ul><li>try to encapsulate all the logic of a component in isolation, so it can be rendered everywhere with ease &#8211; for example, in different screens and sections</li><li>all the CRUD operations go inside the <strong>controllers / providers</strong> for the data it needs, and that data is passed to <strong>presentational</strong> components<ul><li>one common scenario is redux/vuex — data is persisted to a store and is treated as a single source of truth, and container components extract the relevant data</li></ul></li></ul>



<h4>2 — Separating presentational and business / controller layer</h4>



<ul><li>not all components need to be connected to stores, backend API or some other service</li><li>by making components &#8220;data source agnostic&#8221;, reusability is greatly increased </li></ul>



<h4>3 — Using a standardized way of fetching the data </h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="rest-hooks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://resthooks.io/" target="_blank">rest-hooks</a> is a great example of this principle as it encourages a predictable and readable structure for API calls</li><li>for some projects, using explicit <strong>fetch</strong> calls may be sufficient, but if you&#8217;re dealing with a lot of resources and relationships, having an abstraction over backend API can be helpful</li></ul>



<p></p>

<h4>4 — Having a common user input strategy </h4>



<ul><li>forms, select tags, validations, error states all fall into this category</li><li>UI component libraries such as <a href="https://ant.design/components/form/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="antd (opens in a new tab)">antd</a> provide a solution for this out of the box</li><li>if you&#8217;re creating an app without a UI library, consider putting a bit more emphasis on standardizing these elements for better UX</li></ul>



<h4>5 — Writing automated tests </h4>



<ul><li>components are, in my experience, best tested with integration tests, specifically with <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Cypress (opens in a new tab)">Cypress</a></li><li>business logic should be thoroughly covered with unit tests</li><li>e2e are valuable for smoke testing larger user flows; they can help detect regressions between the client and the API</li></ul>



<h4>6 — Using storybook for creating reusable components </h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="storybook.js.org  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank">storybook.js.org</a></li><li>great way to collaborate with designers and discuss functionality</li><li>serves as a &#8220;living style guide&#8221; for your app</li></ul>



<h4>7 — Using linters and formatters</h4>



<ul><li>examples of linters — ESLint, stylelint</li><li>most bootstrap tools, such as create-react-app, pre-install linters for you, but if you&#8217;re on a legacy codebase, they might not be applied</li><li>they can help you catch bugs, but they can also be used in defining code style for your team — this can help in reducing mental load when developing upon a feature that you&#8217;ve inherited from your colleague</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="sonarJS eslint plugin (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/SonarSource/eslint-plugin-sonarjs" target="_blank">sonarJS eslint plugin</a> can help improve code quality as it checks for logical structure</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="prettier (opens in a new tab)" href="https://prettier.io/" target="_blank">prettier</a> is an awesome code formatter that you set up only once, and never think about it again — very useful when working in a team</li></ul>



<p></p>

<h4>8 — Avoiding global styles</h4>



<ul><li>overrides and resets can be made global</li><li>CSS modules or CSS-in-JS are some of the technologies that can help in achieving scoped, isolated styles</li><li>local styles can often lead to better component reusability</li></ul>



<h4>9 — Using structured version control </h4>



<ul><li>using a branching model<ul><li>e.g. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="gitflow (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank">gitflow</a> — a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen</li><li>having a structure in your version control is indispensable for working in a team, but it is helpful even when working on your own</li></ul></li><li>linting commit messages &#8211; <a href="https://commitlint.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">commitlint</a><ul><li>useful in creating a changelog and finding bugs as the project develops</li><li><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="angular's commit message rules (opens in a new tab)">angular&#8217;s commit message rules</a> are often applicable to any software project, and commitlint can help you in keeping those messages consistent with the ruleset</li></ul></li></ul>



<h4>10 — Keeping a changelog</h4>



<ul><li>at the beginning of every project, it&#8217;s usually easy to keep track of all the changes in your mental context</li><li>as the project grows, the changelog can serve as a central place for discovering notable changes to a codebase, even months and years into development</li></ul>



<h4>The never-ending list</h4>



<p>That&#8217;s all folks — there could surely be many more items added to the list, depending on the project domain and technology, but I find these can improve many frontend apps radically. Almost all of the principles can be applied progressively and by priority defined by you and your team — so no need to worry about applying them all at once.</p>

<h3>In my <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/mvp-vs-mvvm-choosing-the-right-android-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="previous blog (opens in a new tab)">previous blog</a>, I’ve told you how and why we switched from a well established MVP architecture to the newly created MVVM. As promised, in this episode I’ll tell you a bit more about it, describe its key points and elaborate how it tackles all the cumbers which its predecessor (MVP) occasionally produced.</h3>



<p><strong>Just a reminder:</strong> both of our base projects (MVP, MVVM) can be cloned and <strong>used as a free starting pack</strong>. MVVM skeleton contains a demo project which demonstrates how to use many of our base classes and methods. So feel free to dig in!</p>



<h4>STARTING UP</h4>



<p>As the MVVM structure suggests, every screen we create (assuming there is a business logic) will contain three layers &#8211; the <strong>Model</strong>, the <strong>View</strong> and the <strong>ViewModel</strong>. The hierarchy of the layers is simple &#8211; they are stacked above each other, so each one only cares about the one it’s standing on. Hence, in a basic scenario, each layer (with the exception of the Model) depends only on the layer below it, which makes the code much more testable. </p>



<p><strong>The graph below illustrates the hierarchy and the mutual dependencies of the layers.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_leopoldovic_blog_mvvm_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5449" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_leopoldovic_blog_mvvm_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_leopoldovic_blog_mvvm_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_leopoldovic_blog_mvvm_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_leopoldovic_blog_mvvm_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_leopoldovic_blog_mvvm_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>When we agreed on the structure, we had to define the frameworks/tools/libraries to construct it. And yes, we had the debates as well &#8211; RxJava vs. Kotlin coroutines, Dagger vs. Koin, etc&#8230; </p>



<p>Long story short &#8211; we could just not waive all of the precious operators <strong>RxJava</strong> gives us, so we decided to stick with it. We picked <strong>Dagger</strong> over Koin due to much better performance, <strong>OkHttp</strong> and <strong>Retrofit</strong> for networking, <strong>Room</strong> for local caching and we used the rest of the <strong>JetPack</strong> components as the glue (LiveData, ViewModel) between the layers.</p>



<p>We started by creating the dependency injection graph. You can find the setup under the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="commons → dagger (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/dagger" target="_blank">commons → dagger</a> folder of our base project. I won’t hold onto it for long, since it’s a thing which requires the least interaction with while coding. Its main purpose is to provide us with components which can be injected and injected in. Therefore, make sure to contribute a new activity/fragment in binding modules and to provide yourself with a repo or a <strong>ViewModel</strong> in <strong>repo/ViewMode</strong>l modules. </p>



<p>In our architecture, each vital component (a <strong>View/ViewModel/Repo</strong>) extends a base class which sets the foundations up. We decided to start building from the ground floor, so we commenced with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BaseRepo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/BaseRepo.kt" target="_blank">BaseRepo</a> class. It might seem like reverse logic since we have to build for the upper floor(s) in advance, but it really helped us to shape the propagation of data which a <strong>ViewModel</strong> will eventually expose to its observers.</p>



<p><strong>Let me just quickly remind you about the requirements (more about them in the previous <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="blog (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/mvp-vs-mvvm-choosing-the-right-android-architecture/" target="_blank">blog</a>) we kept up to while creating the new skeleton:</strong></p>



<ul><li>we want to reduce boilerplate to a minimum (e.g. RxJava calls etc.)</li><li>we want a set of default actions to be present under the hood (e.g. default loader or displaying error messages, default schedulers etc.), but again, those actions must be easily overridable if necessary</li><li>the code must be generic enough to fit all the cases we might encounter, and easily adaptable if there is a case which is not directly supported by the foundations</li></ul>



<p>BaseRepo’s tasks include fetching data and firing API/database requests. For now, we created generic methods to make the calls and cut the boilerplate off regarding the Observables and the Completables. However, we will expand this in the near future to cover all the Rx return types. For now, we are happy with this since 99% of the requests we make return either an Observable (Single) or Completable. </p>



<p><strong>In general, there are three cases which must be covered in order to fully close the circle:</strong></p>



<ul><li>A method which fires a request to either database or API (oneSideCall) and returns data</li><li>A method which fires a request to both database and API (twoSideCall) and returns data</li><li>A method which doesn’t return any data</li></ul>



<p>Those methods, most certainly, must also provide us with some extra actions, in case we want to save the data returned by the call, or to perform certain actions in case the call fails. </p>



<p><strong>For instance, take a look at our oneSideCall:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/**
 * Wraps the fetched data with Observable&lt;[ResourceState]> for appropriate ViewModel provision.
 *
 * When fetching the data from an API, provide a @param saveCallData to store the fetched data
 * locally (optionally). Otherwise, use just @param call.
 *
 * Optionally, provide a @param performOnError definition if you would like to perform certain actions
 * in case and when the @param call fails (e.g. provide local data only in case the remote call fails).
 */
fun &lt;T> oneSideCall(
    call: () -> Observable&lt;T>,
    saveCallData: ((data: T) -> Unit)? = null,
    performOnError: () -> Observable&lt;T> = { Observable.empty() }
): Observable&lt;ResourceState&lt;T>> {
    return call()
        .map { ResourceState.success(it) }
        .doAfterNext {
            if (saveCallData != null) {
                it.data?.let { newData -> saveCallData(newData) }
            }
        }
        .onErrorResumeNext { error: Throwable ->
            Observable.mergeDelayError(
                performOnError()
                    .map { ResourceState.success(it) }
                    .onErrorResumeNext { subError: Throwable ->
                        Observable.just(
                            ResourceState.error(
                                handleError(subError),
                                null
                            )
                        )
                    },
                Observable.just(
                    ResourceState.error(
                        handleError(error),
                        null
                    )
                )
            )
        }
} </pre>



<p>You are free to pass it any call which returns an Observable&lt;T>, so map it, flatMap it or do whatever you want while passing it as an argument, but leave the boilerplate to the BaseRepo. In case that was an API call whose data must be saved, pass a database method as the <strong>saveCallData</strong> argument. In case you want to load the database data only when the remote call fails, pass a <strong>performOnError</strong> definition. Pretty handy, right? </p>



<p><strong>Let’s take a look on how fetching the current weather for a city would look like using the oneSideCall:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">override fun getCurrentWeatherForCity(cityName: String): Observable> {
    return oneSideCall(
        call = { api.getWeatherForCity(cityName) },
        saveCallData = { database.weatherDao().saveWeatherData(it) },
        performOnError = { database.weatherDao().getWeatherData(cityName) }
    )
}</pre>



<p>That’s pretty neat! Now, you may have noticed that each of these <strong>BaseRepo</strong> methods wraps the result with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ResourceState (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/basemodels/ResourceState.kt" target="_blank">ResourceState</a>. This is our custom wrapper class which classifies the data fetching state as either Success, Loading or Error.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/**
 * Created by lleopoldovic on 23/09/2019.
 *
 *
 * Base class to wrap each database/api provision with.
 *
 * Status values are used by view (activity/fragment) to indicate the fetch status of a request,

 */ 

data class ResourceState&lt;out T> (val status: Status, val data: T?, val error: BaseError?) {
    companion object {
        fun &lt;T> loading(data: T? = null): ResourceState&lt;T> {
            return ResourceState(Status.LOADING, data, null)
        }
        fun &lt;T> success(data: T?): ResourceState&lt;T> {
            return ResourceState(Status.SUCCESS, data, null)
        }
        fun &lt;T> error(baseError: BaseError, data: T? = null): ResourceState&lt;T> {
             return ResourceState(Status.ERROR, data, baseError)
        }
}</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/**
 * Created by lleopoldovic on 23/09/2019.

 *
 * Status of a resource that is provided to the view (activity/fragment).
 */ 
enum class Status {
    SUCCESS,
    ERROR,
    LOADING
}</pre>



<p>That’s because we want to provide our users with proper feedback regarding the request state. Since our in-house backend team often creates custom messages for different types of errors which might occur, we want to present our users with the custom error message as well. This is another benefit of our BaseRepo methods. They will wrap every return data with proper ResourceState definition. Introduction of such a wrapper class can be expensive since it can easily tangle the whole data journey from a repo to a View. Therefore, we made sure to keep it under the hood and expose it to developers in the minimum of cases. Our BaseRepo methods will also handle any errors which might occur during the request. For easier propagation of the error information to other layers of the application, we created a BaseError class which holds all the error info together. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/**
 * Created by lleopoldovic on 25/10/2019.
 */ 

data class BaseError(
    val errorMessage: String = baseErrorMessage,
    val errorCode: Int = ResponseCodes.UNDEFINED.code,
    val validationErrors: ApiInterface.ValidationErrors = ApiInterface.ValidationErrors()
) {
    companion object {
        var baseErrorMessage: String = "Some error occurred.\nPlease try later."
        var localErrorMessage: String = "Local error occurred."
        var networkErrorMessage: String = "Network error, check your internet connection."
        var emptyErrorBodyMessage: String = "{\"message\":\"Empty error body\"}"
    }
}</pre>



<p>If a validation error occurred and we want to specially mark an input field which relates to it (e.g. wrong e-mail), we can easily do that. If an authorization error occurs and we have to logout the user, we can easily pass an error code related to the error and, among other things, bring the user to the login screen, etc.</p>



<p><strong>To sum the BaseRepo up:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Boilerplate reduced &#8211; CHECK </li><li>A set of actions present under the hood &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Generic and easily adaptable code &#8211; CHECK</li></ul>



<h4>LET’S GET THAT DATA</h4>



<p>The middle man of this data delivery service is a ViewModel. Its responsibility is to request a data set from the Model (repo), parse it if necessary and expose it to whomever needs to observe it. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/BaseViewModel.kt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BaseViewModel (opens in a new tab)">BaseViewModel</a> class is much simpler than the <a href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/BaseRepo.kt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BaseRepo (opens in a new tab)">BaseRepo</a> class since it extends the ViewModel class which deals with most of the tricky stuff for us. Hence, we used it to auto-clear the CompositeDisposable and to truncate the boilerplate. Again, we have a couple of generic methods present under the hood. </p>



<p><strong>For instance, let’s take a look at the observableCall method:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/**
 * Used for creating observable calls to remove RxJava boilerplate.
 *
 * On the other hand, if a custom action is required while doOnSubscribe and subscribe are
 * triggered, your are free to override the action. In that case, be sure to update your
 * liveData values manually.
 */
fun &lt;T> observableCall(
    liveData: MutableLiveData&lt;ResourceState&lt;T>>,
    call: () -> Observable&lt;ResourceState&lt;T>>,
    doOnSubscribe: ((disposable: Disposable) -> Unit)? = null,
    subscribe: ((data: ResourceState&lt;T>) -> Unit)? = null,
    scheduler: Scheduler = schedulers.io()
) {
    @Suppress("unused")
    call()
        .subscribeOn(scheduler)
        .observeOn(schedulers.ui())
        .doOnSubscribe {
            compositeDisposable.add(it)
            if (doOnSubscribe != null) {
                doOnSubscribe(it)
            } else {
                liveData.value = ResourceState.loading()
            }
        }
        .subscribe {
            if (subscribe != null) {
                subscribe(it)
            } else {
                liveData.postValue(it)
            }
        }
} </pre>



<p>The method updates the liveData values automatically, but you are free to more than easily override those actions if a custom work is required. </p>



<p><strong>A call for getting the current weather now looks like this:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">fun getCurrentWeatherData(city: String) {
    observableCall(
        liveData = _weatherData,
        call = { repo.getCurrentWeatherForCity(city) }
    )
}</pre>



<p>Pretty clean and readable, right? We used RxJava and Observables to pass the information from a repo to a ViewModel, and now we’ll use LiveData to expose it to observers. Notice that if you open an Rx stream to an Observable Room query, it will never complete, so we are able to constantly listen for the Model updates, and that’s <strong>the reason behind the merge operator implementation</strong> of the BaseRepo methods!</p>



<p>In case the data has to be parsed, we created a map extension which enables you to map the data wrapped with the ResourceState without worrying about the wrapper class itself. Do what you have to do with the data, and we’ll make sure to unwrap it and wrap it back up to ResourceState for you.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">fun &lt;T, R> Observable&lt;ResourceState&lt;T>>.mapData(customMap: (item: T) -> R): Observable&lt;ResourceState&lt;R>> {
    return this.map { rs ->
        rs.data?.let { data ->
            ResourceState(
                rs.status,
                customMap(data),
                rs.error
            )
        } ?: ResourceState(rs.status, null, rs.error)
    }
}</pre>



<p><strong>Let’s recap:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Boilerplate reduced &#8211; CHECK</li><li>A set of easily overridable default actions present under the hood &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Generic and easily adaptable code &#8211; CHECK</li></ul>



<h4>CAN I FINALLY SEE IT</h4>



<p>Yep. We’ve come to the top. There’s the View. Get it? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<p>Before getting into observing the LiveData values from a ViewModel, I’ll quickly mention the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BaseView (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/BaseView.kt" target="_blank">BaseView</a> interface. It provides us with a set of base methods each Activity/Fragment will implement. That gives us a bit of flexibility for the actions that follow. Each Activity/Fragment should extend the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BaseActivity (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/BaseActivity.kt" target="_blank">BaseActivity</a>/<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BaseFragment (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/BaseFragment.kt" target="_blank">BaseFragment</a> class which deals with the mandatory dependency injection for you and makes sure you have access to the BaseView methods. And now comes the best part. It would be a hassle if we’d have to manually take care of displaying loading/error states of requests, even if they should be displayed with their default UI actions. So as the cherry on top, we created a custom observer for the ResourceState values wrapped with LiveData.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/**
 * Created by lleopoldovic on 02/10/2019.
 */ 
class ResourceStateObserver&lt;T>(
    private val view: BaseView,
    private val onSuccess: (data: T?) -> Unit,
    private val onLoading: (isLoading: Boolean) -> Unit = DEFAULT_LOADING_ACTION,
    private val onError: (baseError: BaseError) -> Unit = DEFAULT_ERROR_ACTION
) : Observer&lt;ResourceState&lt;T>> {

    companion object {
        private val DEFAULT_ERROR_ACTION: (baseError: BaseError) -> Unit = {}
        private val DEFAULT_LOADING_ACTION: (isLoading: Boolean) -> Unit = {}
    }
    override fun onChanged(t: ResourceState&lt;T>?) {
        // Loading state handler:
        onLoadingActionCheck(onLoading, isLoading = t?.status == Status.LOADING)

        // Error/success state handler:
        if (t?.status == Status.ERROR) {
            onErrorActionCheck(onError, baseError = t.error ?: BaseError(errorMessage = BaseError.baseErrorMessage))
            // If a response code needs to be handled specifically, add the new case here
            when (t.error?.errorCode) {
                ResponseCodes.UNAUTHORIZED.code -> view.onLogout()
            }
        } else if (t?.status == Status.SUCCESS) {
            onSuccess(t.data)
        }
    }
    private fun onLoadingActionCheck(
        onLoadingAction: (isLoading: Boolean) -> Unit = DEFAULT_LOADING_ACTION,
        isLoading: Boolean
    ) {
        if (onLoadingAction === DEFAULT_LOADING_ACTION) {
            // A lambda is NOT defined - use the default value
            view.showProgressCircle(isLoading)
        } else {
            // A lambda is defined - no default value used
            onLoading(isLoading)
        }
    }
    private fun onErrorActionCheck(
        onErrorAction: (baseError: BaseError) -> Unit = DEFAULT_ERROR_ACTION,
        baseError: BaseError
    ) {
        if (onErrorAction === DEFAULT_ERROR_ACTION) {
            // A lambda is NOT defined - use the default value
            view.showError(baseError.errorMessage)
        } else {
            // A lambda is defined - no default value used
            onError(baseError)
        }
    }
}</pre>



<p>All it requires is the BaseView and a success action. In case you haven’t provided a custom loading/error action, the default ones will be executed. On the other hand, if you do want to provide them, it’s super-easy to do it! </p>



<p><strong>So, binding UI with the fetched values and simultaneously taking care of displaying error/loading states has never been quicker:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">viewModel.weatherData.observe(viewLifecycleOwner, ResourceStateObserver(this, 
    onSuccess = { /* Populate UI */ }
))</pre>



<p>In case an extra action is required to display an error or a loading state, help yourselves to one of our many lambdas. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">viewModel.weatherData.observe(viewLifecycleOwner, ResourceStateObserver(this,
    onSuccess = { /* Populate UI <em>/ },     </em>
    <em>onLoading = { /</em>Custom loading action<em>/ },     </em>
    <em>onError   = { /</em>Custom error action*/ }
))</pre>



<p><strong>Again, let’s check our list:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Boilerplate reduced &#8211; CHECK</li><li>A set of easily overridable default actions present under the hood &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Generic and easily adaptable code &#8211; CHECK</li></ul>



<h4>PAGINATION</h4>



<p>Since 95% of pagination we create (and we do it quite often) is page-keyed pagination, we decided to create a generic page-keyed paginator. You can find the code under <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="common → mvvm → pagination (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/-/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/pagination" target="_blank">common → mvvm → pagination</a>. It is the JetPack PagingLibrary in a generic form to minimise the effort of establishing one, and maximize the results we can gain from it. </p>



<p><strong>The setup consist out of three generic classes:</strong></p>



<ul><li>GenericPaginationDataSource</li><li>GenericPaginationDataSourceFactory</li><li>GenericPaginationParams</li></ul>



<p>If you do plan to use those, make sure to extend the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BasePaginationViewModel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/-/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/pagination/BasePaginationViewModel.kt" target="_blank">BasePaginationViewModel</a> instead of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="BaseViewModel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/mvvm/BaseViewModel.kt" target="_blank">BaseViewModel</a>, since it will provide you with additional methods for setting the paginator up, and it will wrap the return type of the paginator with the ResourceState. Since there is no paginated data available with the weather API, we integrated a news API to test it out. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<p><strong>This is all the code necessary to create a paginated news fetch:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">class NewsViewModel @Inject constructor(
    schedulers: SchedulerProvider,
    private val newsRepo: NewsRepo
) : BasePaginationViewModel(schedulers) {

    // Lateinits
    private lateinit var newsDataSourceFactory: GenericPaginationDataSourceFactory&lt;News, NewsPaginationParams>

    // LiveDatas
    lateinit var newsList: LiveData&lt;ResourceState&lt;PagedList&lt;News>>>

    // Other
    private var paginationParams: NewsPaginationParams = NewsPaginationParams("").apply {
        pageNumber = 1
        loadBefore = false
    }
    init {
        newsDataSourceFactory = generatePaginationDataSourceFactory(
            paginationParams = paginationParams,
            call = { newsRepo.getNewss(it as NewsPaginationParams) }
        )
        val newsPagedListConfig = generateDefaultPaginationConfig(
            paginationParams = paginationParams
        )
        newsList = buildLivePagedListWithState(newsDataSourceFactory, newsPagedListConfig)
    }
    fun search(query: String) {
        newsDataSourceFactory.reInit(paginationParams.apply {
            this.query = query; this.pageNumber = 1
        })
    }
}</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">data class NewsPaginationParams(
    var query: String
): GenericPaginationParams()</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">viewModel.newsList.observe(viewLifecycleOwner, ResourceStateObserver(this,
    onSuccess = { it?.let { data -> newsListAdapter.submitList(data) } }
))</pre>



<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>



<p>There are plenty of other things involved with this base project, like the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MyFirebaseMessagingService (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/firebase/MyFirebaseMessagingService.kt" target="_blank">MyFirebaseMessagingService</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="NotificationChannelsHelper (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/mvvmtemplate/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bornfight/common/firebase/NotificationChannelsHelper.kt" target="_blank">NotificationChannelsHelper</a> etc. which I haven’t mentioned, and which do play an important role in everyday coding. We might cover those in another blog. Until then, feel free to explore the rest of the setup and the rest of the helper classes and methods as well. We also have a bonus dependency implemented &#8211; the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bornfight Android Utils (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/bornfight/AndroidUtils" target="_blank">Bornfight Android Utils</a> which are giving us an even better boost: </p>



<ul><li>GenericAdapter (recycler view)</li><li>GenericArrayAdapter</li><li>TextViewUtils</li></ul>



<p><strong>Combined with our new architecture, they create a real powerhouse. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>



<p>Now that we’ve introduced you to our new setup, feel free to give it a shot and tell us what you think about it! In time, it will certainly experience some makeovers, extra polishing and fine-tuning, but even now it amps us up by giving us additional boost right from the start.</p>

<h3><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Cypress (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank">Cypress</a> is a great tool for front-end testing. It provides features such as mocking HTTP responses, stubbing objects and methods, and simulating user interaction.</h3>



<p>It can be used as a fully-fledged front-end testing framework for unit, integration and e2e tests. This post assumes you are already somewhat familiar with Cypress and its methodologies, and it serves as a guide for advanced configuration which can help you structure and organize your tests. So, let&#8217;s get straight to the point.</p>



<p>When first <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#Opening-Cypress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="installing and running Cypress with npm or yarn (opens in a new tab)">installing and running Cypress with npm or yarn</a>, it will generate some default tests and configuration for you.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, these files and directories are:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">// configuration
./cypress.json 
// directories with respective files / tests
./cypress/fixtures/ 
./cypress/integration/examples/
./cypress/plugins/
./cypress/support/</pre>



<p>The default command for running Cypress in interactive mode is <strong>./node_modules/.bin/cypress open</strong> and it will, by default, use <strong>cypress.json</strong> as a configuration file.</p>



<p>An example of a configuration file:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">{
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
    "integrationFolder": "cypress/integration",
}</pre>



<p>Cypress will also, by default, run all tests from the <strong>integration</strong> directory, supporting nested directories. We could add all our unit, integration and e2e tests to the <strong>integration</strong> directory, but we want to configure some things differently &#8211; depending on our environment. For example, we could avoid some API calls from the app by completely blocking the host from the configuration file.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say we want to mock the response for the <strong>foo</strong> resource from our API. In our Cypress test, we&#8217;ll do something like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">describe("foo", () => {
    it("should fetch and render foo", () => {
      cy.server();
      // load fixture and mock response
      cy.fixture("foo").then((response) => {
        cy.route({
          method: "GET",
          // you can also setup base url in cypress config
          // it can be used as Cypress.env('BASE_API_URL')
          url: "https://api.my-app.com/foo/**",
          response: response,
        });
     });
     // …rest of the test
}));</pre>



<p>By specifying the same host of our backend API in blacklistHosts, Cypress will allow creating mock responses for the blocked domain, but it will intercept and disallow any other response to that same domain. This could be a handy setup for integration testing, where you want to test a feature in a very specific scenario, mocking all the requests and data the application needs. This is a powerful configuration, but for e2e tests, we don&#8217;t want to block the real API because we need to test front-end with the real back-end services. Therefore, we need to split our configs.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll first create a <strong>cypress-integration.json</strong> file and place it inside the auto-generated <strong>cypress</strong> directory. And then we specify another path for the location of the tests &#8211; for our use case, that is <strong>cypress/tests/integration</strong>. Notice the change from <strong>integration</strong> to <strong>tests</strong> naming. The naming doesn&#8217;t need to be replicated, so feel free to use directory names which suit you and your team.</p>



<p>Example <strong>cypress-integration.json</strong> file:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">{
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
    "integrationFolder": "cypress/tests/integration",
    "blacklistHosts": ["api.my-app.com"]
}</pre>



<p>Now, to run only those tests suites for integration tests, we need to add commands in our <strong>package.json</strong>. <strong>&#8220;cypress:open:integration&#8221;</strong> is for the &#8220;interactive&#8221; mode, and <strong>cypress:run:integration</strong> is for running in &#8220;CI&#8221; mode.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">{
 "scripts": {
   "cypress:open:integration": "cypress open --config-file cypress/cypress-integration.json",
   "cypress:run:integration": "cypress run --config-file cypress/cypress-integration.json"
 }
}</pre>



<p>Now, you can repeat this process for other environments, such as e2e, storybook or unit tests, and provide different configurations for them. That&#8217;s it, thank you for reading!</p>

<h3>Behavior-Driven Development is an Agile software development process that promotes collaboration between developers, software testers (QA) and the non-technical, business side in a software development process.</h3>



<p>Outcome of their meetings are structured scenarios which act as requirements for product owners, acceptance criteria for developers, description for stakeholders, test cases and automation scripts for testers.</p>



<p>Our focus in this blog will be on test cases and automation scripts for testers. However, if you would like to read more about BDD itself, you can check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="my previous blog (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/behavior-driven-development-how-to-find-bugs-before-coding-starts/" target="_blank">my previous blog</a> which explains the BDD processes more thoroughly.</p>



<h4>Cucumber and Gherkin</h4>



<p>Behavior-Driven Development is supported by a software tool called <strong>Cucumber</strong>. It is used to write acceptance tests for the software, and to run the tests in BDD style.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_01.png?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5273" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_01.png 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_01-300x159.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_01-1024x543.png 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_01-768x407.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_01-1536x814.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption><strong>Source: miro.medium.com</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p><br> <p>Cucumber uses a plain language parser called <strong>Gherkin</strong>, which is of great importance to the Cucumber BDD approach. Thanks to Gherkin, we can write expected software behaviors specified in a logical and structured language that everyone on the project can understand &#8211; from developers to the customers.</p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_02-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5274" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_02-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body_02.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Feature File</strong> is a starting point of the Cucumber test because it serves as an automation test script and the living documentation. Feature files can contain scenarios, scenario steps, scenario outline, tags and examples. All the feature files end with the &#8220;.feature” extension (Login.feature).</p>



<h5><strong>Example 1:</strong></h5>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feature:</span> GoogleSearching
     In order to find company information            
     As a user
     I need to be able to search Google

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenario:</span> Google Searching
     <strong>Given</strong> a web browser is at "Google" homepage
     <strong>When</strong> the user enters "Bornfight" into the search bar
     <strong>Then</strong> links related to "Bornfight" are shown on the result page

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenario:</span> Video search
     <strong>Given</strong> Google search results for "Bornfight" are shown
     <strong>When</strong> the user clicks on the "Videos" link at the top of the result page
     <strong>Then</strong> videos related to "Bornfight" are shown on the result page</pre>



<p><strong>Feature</strong> gives information about a standalone unit or functionality of a project. It may also contain <strong>Description</strong> of the feature (In order to…As a user…I need to be able…).</p>



<p><strong>Scenario</strong> represents a particular functionality of a feature which is under test. One feature file can contain more than one scenario, but one scenario can have only one behaviour. If you felt a need to use <strong>When</strong> and <strong>Then</strong> more than once in your scenario, it means that there are two behaviours and there is a space for two separate scenarios. Referring to the Example 1, this would be an incorrect way to write the scenario.</p>



<h5><strong>Example 2:</strong></h5>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenario:</span> Google Video search shows videos<br><strong>Given</strong> a web browser is at “Google” homepage<br><strong>When</strong> the user enters “Bornfight” into the search bar<br><strong>Then</strong> links related to “Bornfight” are shown on the result page<br><strong>When</strong> the user clicks on the “Videos” link at the top of the result page<br><strong>Then</strong> videos related to “Bornfight” are shown on the result page</pre>



<p>You probably noticed here that <strong>When</strong> and <strong>Then</strong> are repeated, and there are two different actions/behaviours meaning that you should write two different scenarios. By seeing the scenario, any of the stakeholders should be able to understand what is being tested. Scenario is always followed by <strong>scenario steps</strong> in the Given-When-Then format. </p>



<p><strong>Given &#8211; Prediction &#8211; Context<br>When &#8211; Action &#8211; Event<br>Then &#8211; Outcomes &#8211; Result</strong></p>



<p>This is a Gherkin format where the steps must be written strictly in this order and none of them should be repeated. If you want to add more than one line in each step, you can use <strong>And</strong> or <strong>But</strong>. Both of them are logically the same, except for the fact that But is used in a negative way. </p>



<h5><strong>Example 3:</strong></h5>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>Given</strong> a web browser is at “Google” homepage<br><strong>When</strong> the user enters “Apple Inc.” into the search bar<br><strong>And</strong> the user search for images<br><strong>Then</strong> the images related to “Apple Inc.” should be shown<br><strong>But</strong> the images related to fruit Apple should not be shown</pre>



<p><strong>Scenario outline</strong>, together with <strong>Examples</strong>, is used when you perform the same test with different data sets. In this example, we checked if all the team members are presented on the company’s web page.</p>



<h5>Example 4:</h5>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feature:</span> CheckBornfightTeam
    In order to check if Bornfight web is updated with the new team members
    As a Bornfight web visitor
    I need to see new team member's name in the list

<strong>Scenario Outline:</strong> Check Bornfight Team

<strong>Given</strong> I am on page "/team" 
<strong>When</strong> I look up for the team member 
<strong>Then</strong> I should see "&lt;name>" name

<strong>Examples:</strong>
     | name                |
     | Kristijan Bujanović |
     | Marko Kruljac       |
     | Josip Trbuščić      |
     | Ajdin Mustafić      |</pre>



<h4>Tags</h4>



<p>Scenarios and features can contain tags and they are marked with @. With tags, we can group scenarios and features in an order that we want to run them. For example,  we can mark important scenarios with @important or scenarios for smoke testing with @smoke… <strong>Tags are very useful for arranging scenarios when you have 10 &#8211; 20 of them in one feature.</strong></p>



<h4>Steps definitions</h4>



<p>Defining all the elements in the feature file doesn’t mean that the tests are ready to be executed. We have defined test scenarios, but the Cucumber doesn’t really know which piece of code should be executed for each line of the scenario. For that reason, we need a steps definition file, <strong>a glue between the scenario and the application</strong>. In the steps definition file, we have a mapping between each step of the scenario and the code of function to be executed. </p>



<p>In our examples, we use <strong>PHP</strong> with <strong>Codeception</strong> and <strong>Selenium</strong> to write tests and run them in the browser. Here you can see how each line in our scenario looks as a code.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenario:</span> Google Searching<br>     <strong>Given</strong> a web browser is at "Google" homepage<br>     public function aWebBrowserIsAtHomepage($arg1)<br>     {<br><br>     $this-&gt;amOnPage('/'); <br>     }</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>When</strong> the user enters "Bornfight" into the search bar<br>     public function theUserEntersIntoTheSearchBar($arg1)<br>     {<br>         $this-&gt;pressKey("//input[@name='q']", $arg1, \Facebook\WebDriver\WebDriverKeys::ENTER);<br>     }</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>Then</strong> links related to "Bornfight" are shown on the result page<br>     public function linksRelatedToAreShownOnTheResultPage($arg1)<br>      {<br>         $this-&gt;waitForText($arg1);<br>         $this-&gt;see($arg1);<br><br>      }</pre>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>This is one basic example of how the scenario steps and steps definitions are connected. However, depending on the requirements of the test and the complexity of the tested feature, writing step definitions can get more complicated. While on the other hand, writing scenario steps should remain basic and easy to understand. </p>



<p>As you can see, the scenarios written in Gherkin are a documentation that&#8217;s structured and very easy to understand. A documentation which you can use to run acceptance tests. Also, they are easy to write and edit, therefore we can address them as living documentation. In short, writing feature scenarios in the BDD approach is of great value when it comes to testing, test coverage, documenting features, editing documentation and confirming that the feature works as it was intended to.</p>

<h3>Software architecture is probably one of the most popular topics among developers, regardless of the platform you build for. With all the available frameworks and tools for asynchronous programming, dependency injection, networking, data caching and view-bindings, many patterns have evolved and some have stood out from the bunch. </h3>



<p>However, it is impossible to find the golden-gem of architecture that will fit everyone, especially if you’re trying to build a sustainable infrastructure as the core. The solution? Constant upgrades and enhancements to fit your needs the best. This story is all about that. It will delineate our transition from one pattern to another, elaborate why we replaced a well worked-out <strong>MVP</strong> base for <strong>MVVM</strong>, and how we did it.</p>



<p><strong>When starting a new project, we use our base (template) project as the ground floor. It contains all the elements we’ll certainly use to code an app:</strong></p>



<ul><li>it imports all the dependencies we’ll use in the project</li><li>it sets up networking/caching/etc. libraries in advance</li><li>it sets up the dependency injection graph</li><li>it contains dozens of utils and helper classes for easier, cleaner and faster coding</li><li>it enforces you to build upon the ground floor and work with the architectural pattern it&#8217;s set-up for</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_timematerials_body01-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4002" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_timematerials_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_timematerials_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_timematerials_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_timematerials_body01.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>A BRIEF MVP IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW</h4>



<p>Our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MVP template project (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gitlab.com/bornfight-mobile/android-public/androtemplate" target="_blank">MVP template project</a> was created 5 years ago and has been constantly upgraded ever since. In our case, every screen we create (assuming there is a business logic) consists of three layers (the <strong>Model</strong>, the <strong>View</strong> and the <strong>Presenter</strong>) and a contract which binds them.</p>



<ul><li>the <strong>View</strong> should not contain any business logic and it should only manage the UI (for instance &#8211; bind views, programmatically set data which should be shown visually, handle click listeners, text watchers, animations etc.)</li><li>the <strong>Presenter</strong> represents the layer which triggers the business logic classes, transforms and prepares the data for the View &#8211; basically, it is the middle man between the Model and the View</li><li>the <strong>Model</strong> is responsible for database updates and/or web-server communication &#8211; it is a data provider.</li><li>the <strong>Contract</strong> provides a list of methods which the View or the Presenter should implement &#8211; essentially, it enables communication between the two layers</li></ul>



<p>MVP served us well through the years. It is an easy to follow design which deals well with the separation of logic. Unfortunately, it has some drawbacks which start to unfold as more code and more logic gets involved in the MVP triad. </p>



<h4>MVP &#8211; THE DRAWBACKS</h4>



<p>The first problem is the <strong>tight-coupling</strong> between the View and the Presenter. Each View holds a reference to the Presenter and each Presenter holds a reference to the View. In order for the two layers to communicate, a <strong>communication channel</strong> has to be opened via the Contract. This approach results in <strong>less-generic code</strong> (since the Presenter can&#8217;t be used as a layer in the MVP triad for another View). In a heap of communication methods, both the View and the Presenter will <strong>rapidly expand</strong> in the code-line size. There is also an <strong>extra layer of difficulty while writing unit tests</strong>, since there is a View dependency in each Presenter.</p>



<p>However, the biggest downside for us were the <strong>UI updates</strong>. In order to update a View component with data which has to be processed, the View must specifically be instructed by the Presenter. In other words, the View can&#8217;t <strong>“automatically”</strong> listen for the Model updates which the Presenter should expose. Therefore, <strong>“auto”-UI updates</strong> are hardly feasible. In order to succeed, we’d have to moderate the middle layer &#8211; the Presenter. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_bubalo_blueprint_facebook-1024x536.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4034" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_bubalo_blueprint_facebook-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_bubalo_blueprint_facebook-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_bubalo_blueprint_facebook-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>MVVM TO THE RESCUE!</h4>



<p>Luckily for us, there are many different sets of tools that can be used to bridge a View and a business logic layer in a more efficient way. It is only a matter of the concept which suits the architecture you want to tailor the most. In particular, to untangle all the hanks MVP tends to create, but simultaneously keep some of its benefits (easy to understand and build upon, easily maintainable etc.) we decided to go with MVVM and, among other things, with the <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Android Architecture Components (opens in a new tab)">Android Architecture Components</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Moreover, by switching to MVVM, we were able to resolve all the issues mentioned above:</strong></p>



<ul><li>the View and the ViewModel (ex Presenter) are no longer tight-coupled</li><li>the ViewModel code is more generic</li><li>with proper abstractions, we reduced the previously rapid growth of the files for complex screens</li><li>the code is more testable</li><li>the “auto”-UI updates are live</li></ul>



<h4>HOW THAT WORKS?</h4>



<p>Now, every screen consists of three layers:</p>



<ul><li><strong>The View</strong> &#8211; still only handles the UI actions, without any business logic involved in any of its responsibilities</li><li><strong>The ViewModel</strong> &#8211; handles the communication of the view with the rest of the application (calling the business logic classes) and exposes the states/data to whomever needs to consume it using LiveData</li><li><strong>The Model</strong> &#8211; a data provider that updates the database or communicates with a web-server</li></ul>



<p>The complete flow is as follows: there is a View on top, which only has a dependency to (a) ViewModel(s). Since there is no longer a <strong>one-to-one relationship</strong> between the View and (formerly) the Presenter, it is now possible to couple multiple ViewModels to any View, since a ViewModel contains no View references. A ViewModel depends on repositories for fetching/caching data, and a repository will depend on a local and/or remote data source. In testing jargon, there is only one layer beneath the one you’re about to test, that you should mock (with the exception of a repository). Finally, since the states/data is exposed to its listeners via LiveData, we get <strong>“auto”-UI updates</strong> by simply observing it. </p>

<h4>THE TRANSITION</h4>



<p>The idea for the transition did not come overnight. Moreover, we want our architecture to be perfectly balanced, so it’s powerful enough to satisfy the requests of highly-complex projects, and yet lightweight enough to be easily upgradeable and maintainable. </p>



<p><strong>While creating the new skeleton, we kept up to the latter as the compass:</strong></p>



<ul><li>the architecture must leave us enough room to easily add up extra modules (e.g. UseCases etc.) for more complex projects, and it should be sufficient to build smaller and medium projects as is</li><li>the structure we create must be easily testable</li><li>the base set-up should not force us to create or update a large number of files before we even started to work on a screen itself</li><li>we want to reduce boilerplate to minimum (e.g. RxJava calls etc.)</li><li>we want a set of default actions to be present under the hood (e.g. default loader or displaying error messages, default schedulers etc.), but again, those actions must be easily overridable if necessary</li><li>the code must be generic enough to fit all the cases we might encounter and easily adaptable if there is a case which is not directly supported by the foundations</li></ul>



<p>That is a long list to cross, especially if you take into account all the MVP eyesores. We agreed on building a demo project where we’ll try to create the core which will obey our list the most. That project must be simple enough to let us easily experiment with the schemes we try to accomplish, yet robust enough to test all the standard application components (networking, local caching, etc). So, we made a forecast app. The process of putting the things together took about a month, considering all the projects we did aside. It included a lot of brainstorming and mutual consulting, since it&#8217;s sometimes hard to see the whole picture if you’re standing too close to the board. We are very pleased with the final result, and it worked very well for the tasks and the scenarios we’ve put it through so far.</p>



<p>Is it perfect? Definitely not. Is it better than it used to be? We believe so. To discover the true advantages and, even more importantly, the disadvantages, we’ll have to build dozens of applications upon it, the same as we did with the MVP skeleton. One thing is certain &#8211; there is a plenty of brushing up and improvements our new base projects will have to go through, but we will do our best to maximize the benefits we gain from it &#8211; to fasten-up and boost our development speed, performance and quality. Having a base project as a starting point for every new application you make is extremely useful &#8211; if you have managed to set it up to be equally powerful as flexible. Besides performance boost, it appoints a well-designed standard you have to obey right from the start, which makes sure your code is consistent, clean and well-written. </p>



<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>



<p>Is MVP bad? No. Is MVVM better? It depends. For our needs and the complexity of applications we create, MVVM should help us get rid off some drawbacks MVP entails. On the other hand, new drawbacks regarding MVVM will appear, and we have to be ready to ameliorate them since the benefits of a well-designed architecture will always surpass the disadvantages. </p>



<p>If you are interested in how we assembled our new base project, stay tuned for the next blog which will explain it in detail.</p>

<h3>Quality of software should be taken care of from the very beginning of a project. That&#8217;s the core of Behavior-Driven Development!</h3>



<p>Quality is not something that you add when the project is almost done. Like, let’s add 5 sugar spoons of quality, stir it up and pass it to users. You can compare that to adding a Quality Assurance team to a project when most of the software features have already been developed and changing them would require too much time and effort. <strong>Behavior-Driven Development can help you find bugs by involving the QA team and their observation power in the initial state of the project.</strong></p>



<h4>What is Behavior-Driven Development</h4>



<p>Behavior-Driven Development is an agile software development process that promotes collaboration between developers, software testers (QA) and the non-technical, business side in a software development process. Those three parties, in the BDD process, are usually referred to as The Three Amigos. Their goal is to, by means of collaboration, eliminate all the possible errors in the software &#8211; even before any line of code is written.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://www.nicepng.com/png/full/350-3500238_three-amigos-image-chevy-chase-three-amigos-authentic.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="BDD - Three Amigos - Bornfight Blog" class="wp-image-4730" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body01.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body01-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></figure>



<h4>How do they do it?</h4>



<p>BDD has emerged from Test-Driven Development, which is also a test-first approach, whose tests aim to check the application’s functionality (unlike BDD whose tests aim to test the actual behavior of the system from a user’s perspective).</p>



<p>In order to be able to test the behavior of the system, Three Amigos get together, brainstorm and write potential behavior scenarios for testing. The scenarios should be written in plain language that everyone on the project can easily write and understand &#8211; both technical and non-technical people, from clients to testers. Furthermore, to avoid misunderstandings, but also to improve quality and avoid missed deadlines, The Three Amigos meet regularly to discuss how the product will be developed.</p>



<h4>How each of the Three Amigos contribute to writing scenarios?</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Business</strong> (Business Analysts, Product Owner, Project Manager) &#8211; answers to questions like “what problem must be solved”. They provide requirements and they don’t need to have technical knowledge.</li><li><strong>Development</strong> &#8211; answers to questions like “how will the solution be implemented”. They are technical experts and they build the software.</li><li><strong>Testing</strong> (Quality Assurance) &#8211; verifies that the software works correctly. They need to have some technical knowledge, but not as much as Development.</li></ul>



<h4>Behavior-Driven Development Process</h4>



<p>At the beginning of the BDD process, the product owner gets as much information as possible about users and their needs. Then The Three Amigos get together and work out the requirements and write structured scenarios in plain English language that anyone can understand. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/bddsapfiori-170412093545/95/behaviour-driven-development-bdd-closing-the-loop-on-a-great-fiori-ux-13-638.jpg?cb=1491989806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4731" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body02.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_mustafic_bdd_body02-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a></figure>



<p><strong>Written scenarios keep developers focused on delivering precisely what the product owner wants, because the scenarios act like their acceptance criteria and a lodestar during the development process. </strong></p>



<p>For testers, those scenarios can be a base for writing test cases and automated test scripts. This speeds up the testing process and helps achieve greater test coverage.  </p>



<p>Product owner shows the scenarios to the user, client or other stakeholders &#8211; as they can easily understand what’s written, they can confirm that these scenarios describe exactly what the software should do, or not.  </p>



<p>Scenarios written in plain language guarantee that all the people on project, at any point in time, clearly understand what are the requirements and how the software should behave. This helps to avoid any misunderstandings and games of broken telephones. Another outcome is that you have structured and executable documentation, which is very helpful when you need to bring new people to the project or when two different teams build software and do the maintenance. </p>



<p><strong>Here is one made up example &#8211; scenario for a feature “Mobile Account top up with credit card” written in plain language called Gherkin. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Feature:</strong> Mobile Account top up with credit card<br>     In order to top up my mobile account with credit card<br>     As a mobile user<br>     I need to have a valid credit card with sufficient funds</p>



<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Credit card account has sufficient funds</p>



<p>     <strong>Given</strong> the credit card has sufficient funds <br>     <strong>And</strong> the card is valid <br>     <strong>And</strong> the mobile account balance is 5€ <br>     <strong>And</strong> the user enters a valid mobile phone number on the top up page <br>     <strong>When</strong> the user confirms mobile phone number <br>     <strong>And</strong> chooses 15€ top up <br>     <strong>And</strong> enters the correct credit card details <br>     <strong>Then</strong> the user should see a successful top up message <br>     <strong>And</strong> the mobile account balance should be 20€</p>



<p>After reading this scenario and the scenario steps, you can easily understand how the feature should behave when the user has sufficient funds on their credit card account. In order to prevent bugs from happening, our goal is to cover as many scenarios as possible. Also, we can use them afterwards to verify that the feature works correctly. </p>



<p><strong>So, for this feature we could also describe scenarios like “user doesn’t have enough money on his account”, “user doesn’t have a valid credit card” or “user’s sim card is inactive”…and many others. </strong></p>



<h4>BDD solves the problem of QA becoming agile..</h4>



<p>Some companies are still struggling to include a QA team in their agile process, and even though they are doing agile, QA starts with testing and finding bugs at the very end of the software development process. This is usually an expensive and more time-consuming approach. And it is not always just the bugs &#8211; sometimes the project team wanders off from the real software objective trying to impress the clients. It&#8217;s like building a spaceship for a user that just wanted a Vespa to go to work. These kinds of problems can be recognized by writing behavior scenarios, which is where the QA role comes into play. With their ability to put themselves into users&#8217; perspective, they can advise different behavior scenarios in order to make sure that the project goes in the right direction and to eliminate the “what if?” kinds of questions as early as possible.</p>



<h4>Challenges</h4>



<p><strong>As BDD is based on collaboration, one of the biggest challenges is that it requires a high level of business engagement and it is usually hard to get business parties to start to collaborate on this level. </strong></p>



<p>BDD pairs nicely with agile software development, but it&#8217;s really hard to use it with waterfall &#8211; and that is one of its downsides. Another one is that you need to have all of your project people in one place and always on the same page, so it is nearly impossible to outsource, for example, backend developers or a QA team.</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>If you are doing agile in your software development process, Behavior-Driven Development is an add-on that is worth considering. It could save you trouble finding high-severity bugs during the development process or even after the coding is finished. BDD increases the quality of the software and steers your project in the right direction. Furthermore, it makes it easier to include your QA team in every sprint of the agile process.</p>

<h3>After more than a year after the last minor version of PHP, the time has come for a new release. </h3>



<p>While previous minor versions of PHP mostly focused on performance improvements, but this one is fully focused on new features and syntax improvements. All in all, PHP 7.4 gives us the largest number of new features since its last major release that happened almost 4 years ago. </p>



<p>With 7.4, some features that were already implemented in other modern object-oriented programming languages finally came to PHP.  While some of them will have a bigger impact on your codebase, others will be mostly used under the hood of your framework. In this blog, we will go through some of the most important new features and show examples for each of them.</p>



<h4>Typed properties</h4>



<p>The long-anticipated feature of typed properties is finally implemented into the core. This should improve the overall strictly typed patterns in the language and improve the readability of your code. Until now, we used PHPDoc annotations to fulfil this feature, but from now on, a more natural way can be used. All PHP types are accepted with the exception of <strong>void</strong> and <strong>callable</strong>.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">class Post
{
     public string $title = 'PHP 7.4';
     public string $content = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.';
}</pre>



<p>If we change the title value to an integer, this will produce a fatal error.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">class Post
{
     public string $title = 1;
     public string $content = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.';
}</pre>



<p>But even if this sounds fairly straight-forward, we have some &#8216;gotchas&#8217; here with strict and coercive typing modes. If <strong>strict_types=1</strong> at the location of property write, then the value of exactly the same type must be provided. But if <strong>strict_types=0</strong> at the location of property write, then the usual rules for coercive type checks are followed.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>class</strong> Post
{
    <strong>private</strong> string $title;
    <strong>private</strong> string $content;
 
    <strong>public</strong> <strong>function</strong> __construct($title, $content)
    {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->content = $content;
    }
 
    <strong>public</strong> <strong>function</strong> getTitle(): string
    {
        return $this->title;
    }
 
    <strong>public</strong> <strong>function</strong> getContent(): string
    {
        return $this->content;
    }
}
 
<strong>new</strong> Post(1, 'Lorem impsum'); // 1 will be casted to string when <strong>strict_types=0</strong> </pre>



<p>In combination with strictly typed function parameters like getters and setters, this could drastically reduce bugs with type inconsistency which, until now, could be detected only with a third-party tool like PHPStan.</p>



<h4>Arrow functions</h4>



<p>The introduction of arrow functions is another big feature in this release. Arrow functions shorten the syntax of writing callables with some useful extra features. Before 7.4, we used anonymous functions that had a syntax similar to classic functions, but with the extra keyword “use” when variables from parent scope needed to be inherited by an anonymous function.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$even = false;
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
$remainder = $even ? 0 : 1;


$filteredNumbers = array_filter($numbers, function (int $number) use ($remainder) {
    return $number % 2 === $remainder;
});


print_r($filteredNumbers); // returns [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</pre>



<p>By using the arrow function, we now have a cleaner syntax that uses the new reserved keyword “fn” with implicit by-value scope binding.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$even = <strong>false</strong>;
$numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
$remainder = $even ? 0 : 1;
 
 
$filteredNumbers = array_filter($numbers, fn (int $number) => $number % 2 === $remainder);
 
 
print_r($filteredNumbers); <em>// returns [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</em></pre>



<h4>Exceptions in __toString</h4>



<p>Until now, it was impossible to throw exceptions from <strong>__toString</strong> magic method. Now, this is possible &#8211; just like in any other place. It will also no longer result in a fatal error (except when exceptions are not handled properly).</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public function __toString()
{
     if ($this-&gt;id &gt; 10) {
          throw new Exception('Exception from __toString');
     }
     return ''; 
}</pre>



<h4>Null coalescing assignment operator</h4>



<p>In this release, there is also a new operator which tries to replace the old syntax, where we check if a variable is equal to null and then set it to some different value.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">if ($user === null) {
    $user = 'PHP';
}</pre>



<p>This can now be shortened to the new syntax.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$user ??= 'PHP';</pre>



<h4>Unpacking inside arrays</h4>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Spread operator (opens in a new tab)" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax" target="_blank">Spread operator</a> was already widely used in some other programming languages, and is now added to PHP. Before the spread operator, PHP used the <strong>array_merge</strong> function which could still be useful in some situations described below.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$oddNumbers = [1, 3];
$evenNumbers = [2, 4];
$numbers = array_merge($oddNumbers, $evenNumbers);
print_r($numbers); // returns [2, 4, 1, 3]</pre>



<p>We can now accomplish the same result by using the spread operator.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$oddNumbers = [1, 3];
$numbers = [2, 4, …$oddNumbers];

print_r($numbers); // returns [2, 4, 1, 3]</pre>



<p>When using the spread operator with indexed arrays, there is no difference from <strong>array_merge</strong>, but using it with associative arrays could produce strange results.</p>



<p>If we try to unpack one array to another, following will start from the biggest incremented key value of the first array.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$oddNumbers = [
    1 =&gt; 'One',
    3 =&gt; 'Three',
];
$numbers = [
    2 =&gt; 'Two',
    4 =&gt; 'Four',
    …$oddNumbers
];
print_r($numbers); // [2 =&gt; ‘Two’, 4 =&gt; ‘Four’, 5 =&gt; ‘One’, 6 =&gt; ‘Three’]</pre>



<p>This is very different from <strong>array_merge</strong> where the result will be na indexed array starting with index 0 ignoring keys from provided arrays.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$oddNumbers = [
    1 =&gt; 'One',
    3 =&gt; 'Three',
];
$evenNumbers = [
    2 =&gt; 'Two',
    4 =&gt; 'Four',
];
$numbers = array_merge($oddNumbers, $evenNumbers);

print_r($numbers); // [0 =&gt; ‘Two’, 1 =&gt; ‘Four’, 2 =&gt; ‘One’, 3 =&gt; ‘Three’]</pre>



<p>The spread operator will produce a fatal error if the unpacking array contains string keys, when on the other hand <strong>array_merge</strong> will successfully merge it.</p>



<h4>__serialize and __unserialize</h4>



<p>These two new magic methods are added to provide a new serialization mechanism.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">// Returns array with all nessery object data
public function __serialize(): array;

// Sets object state from data array
public function __unserialize(array $data): void;</pre>



<p>This new mechanism replaces the Serializable interface, which is expected to be deprecated in future versions.</p>



<h4>Weak references</h4>



<p>Similar to other object-oriented languages like C# and Java, PHP also implemented weak references. A weak reference is a mechanism that allows the programmer to retain a reference to an object, while at the same time not preventing it from being destroyed. A most common use-case for weak references will be cache mechanisms.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$obj = new stdClass;
$weakref = WeakReference::create($obj);
unset($obj);

<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>We are entering the new year with some useful and very important new features implemented in the PHP core. PHP in the current state and PHP in the future will move more towards the strictly-typed language &#8211; just like its main competitors. This should attract more people which didn’t favor it because of the lack of strict functionality within the core. </p>



<p>In addition to that, even more new features are in the RFC pipeline, or are already implemented and are waiting for a new major release, so we can be very excited to see what&#8217;s coming to PHP.</p>



<p>_____<br>We’re available for partnerships and open for new projects. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bornfight.com/contact/" target="_blank">If you have an idea you’d like to discuss, share it with our team!</a> </p>

<h3>Testing websites without proper data is very hard (if not impossible) and creating meaningful data can be time-consuming if you are not using some kind of automation for this process. </h3>



<p>These automations could save you hours of work. One of the most popular methods for the Symfony framework is to use the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="data fixtures bundle (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures" target="_blank">data fixtures bundle</a> that helps you create objects and store them to the database programmatically. Once you write the code for fixtures, you can load them by using a single command – <strong>php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load</strong>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to use as it doesn’t have many restrictions, which is great for fast development, but things could get messy on bigger projects if you are not careful. I decided to share a few mistakes I made when I started using this bundle and what you could do to avoid them.</p>



<p>First of all, for a class to become a fixture, it needs to extend the <strong>Doctrine\Bundle\FixturesBundle\Fixture</strong> and implement the load method. </p>



<p><strong>Suppose we are creating fixtures for an entity called Team, the class would look something like this:</strong> </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;?php
namespace App\DataFixtures;
use App\Entity\Team;
use Doctrine\Bundle\FixturesBundle\Fixture;
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
class TeamFixture extends Fixture
{
     public function load(ObjectManager $manager)
     {
         $backendTeam = new Team();
         $backendTeam-&gt;setName('backend');     
         $manager-&gt;persist($backendTeam);     
         $manager-&gt;flush(); 
     }
}</pre>



<p>If you have the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="maker bundle (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/symfony/maker-bundle" target="_blank">maker bundle</a>, you can run the <strong>make:fixture</strong> command that will generate an empty fixture class with a placeholder for the load method. After loading the fixtures, we will have the backend team saved in our database.</p>



<h4>1. Separate fixtures into multiple files</h4>



<p>Each entity should have its own fixture class (in its own file, of course) like DeveloperFixtures, TeamFixtures and so on. Entities and relationships between them are usually simple at the beginning, but get more complex as the project grows. It may seem like over-engineering when you start, but separating could be tricky later, so it&#8217;s best to go with this approach from the start.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bornfight_blog_gacic_symfony_fixtures_body01-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4483" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bornfight_blog_gacic_symfony_fixtures_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bornfight_blog_gacic_symfony_fixtures_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bornfight_blog_gacic_symfony_fixtures_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bornfight_blog_gacic_symfony_fixtures_body01.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>2. Prefer dependency over order</h4>



<p>Let&#8217;s say we also have a Developer entity and we want to assign each developer to a team. This means we will need to create teams before developers, or in terms of fixtures – the team fixtures need to be loaded first, so we could use them in developer fixtures. One way to this is to implement <strong>OrderedFixtureInterface</strong>, a method <strong>getOrder()</strong> that has to return a number. The fixtures will now be executed in the ascending order of the value returned by <strong>getOrder()</strong>. Although this may seem handy, as we add more fixtures, we can notice this is very hard to maintain. </p>



<p>If we would want to add new fixtures in the middle of that order, we would have to update the order for all fixtures that need to load later. A better way of achieving dependency is to implementing the <strong>DependentFixtureInterface</strong>. This will require us to add the <strong>getDependencies()</strong> method to our <strong>DeveloperFixtures</strong> class &#8211; it will return an array of class names of the fixtures it depends on:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public function getDependencies(): array
{
     return [
         App\DataFixtures\TeamFixtures::class,
     ];
}</pre>



<h4>3. Fetch object through the reference repository</h4>



<p>One of my favorite features in this bundle is that the fixture classes can keep track of all objects that are created in the current run of load command. This allows you to use the same objects across multiple fixtures, without accessing the database. </p>



<p>In the example with teams and developers, in the <strong>TeamFixtures</strong> you would need to add a line of code that sets the reference:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$backendTeam = new Team();
$backendTeam-&gt;setName('backend');
/**
 * this is where we set the refence
 */
$this-&gt;addReference('team.backend', $backendTeam); </pre>



<p>… and then fetch the same reference in the <strong>DeveloperFixtures</strong>:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/**
 * this is the object we created in TeamFixtures
 */
$backendTeam = $this-&gt;getReference('team.backend'); 
$john = new Developer();
$john-&gt;setTeam($backendTeam);
$john-&gt;setFirstName('john'); 
$this-&gt;addReference('developer.john', $john);</pre>



<h4>4. Keep your data meaningful</h4>



<p>Although the use of <strong>lorem ipsum</strong> is widely excepted, fixtures should be as close to real data as possible. Creating developers with names dev1, dev2 and dev3 will not give as much context in testing as will using real names like John, Eve and Charles. With real names, you will get a much clearer view of how your app will look like in production. </p>



<p>The easiest way to keep your data meaningful is by using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Faker (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker" target="_blank">Faker</a> – a bundle specialized for providing random real-life examples for names, addresses, sentences, files, dates and everything else one could need when creating mock data. Besides this, the bundle offers a great set of additional features like localization, generating multiple objects at once and seeding data. </p>



<p><strong>In our example, we could update the code to add more details to our Developer using  Faker:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$john = new Developer();
$john-&gt;setTeam($backendTeam); 
$john-&gt;setFirstName($this-&gt;faker-&gt;firstName);
$john-&gt;setLastName($this-&gt;faker-&gt;lastName);
$john-&gt;setEmail($this-&gt;faker-&gt;email);
$john-&gt;setLanguage($this-&gt;faker-&gt;languageCode);
$john-&gt;dateOfBirth($this-&gt;faker-&gt;dateTimeThisCentury);
$john-&gt;setExpirence($this-&gt;faker-&gt;numberBetween(0, 30));
$john-&gt;isActive($this-&gt;faker-&gt;boolean(90));
$this-&gt;addReference('developer.john', $john);</pre>



<h4>5. Create entities in batches</h4>



<p>As you can see in the example above, we are not setting any fields manually, so nothing is preventing us from using this code to create multiple developers. We can just wrap the code for creating a developer in a for loop and get, for example, 100 developers with real-life data in our database.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100; ++$i) {
     
     $developer = new Developer();
     $developer-&gt;setTeam($backendTeam); 
     $developer-&gt;setFirstName($this-&gt;faker-&gt;firstName); 
     $developer-&gt;setLastName($this-&gt;faker-&gt;lastName); 
     $developer-&gt;setEmail($this-&gt;faker-&gt;email); 
     $developer-&gt;setLanguage($this-&gt;faker-&gt;languageCode); 
     $developer-&gt;dateOfBirth($this-&gt;faker-&gt;dateTimeThisCentury);       
     $developer-&gt;setExpirence($this-&gt;faker-&gt;numberBetween(0, 30));  
     $developer-&gt;isActive($this-&gt;faker-&gt;boolean(90));
}</pre>



<p><strong>To get a reference to one of these objects in other fixtures, use:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">$randomReferenceKey = sprintf('developer.%d', $this-&gt;faker-&gt;numberBetween(0, 99));
$this-&gt;getReference($randomReferenceKey);</pre>



<p>If you keep these few pieces of advice in mind, you can easily get a bunch of meaningful and maintainable data. Fixtures are not hard to use and you will be happy to find that you have more time to deal with more interesting challenges than creating dummy data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>In the last 2 years, we have built several web applications with Vue.js &#8211; from a banking fraud app and an internal time tracking tool, all the way to interactive Kinect applications and many more.</h3>
<p>This is our story of how we started using Vue.js, why we still use it and how we improved our front-end development thanks to this amazing framework.</p>
<h4>How we discovered Vue.js</h4>
<p>Sometime at the beginning of 2017, as a frontend intern I was still trying to find my place in the world of web development. I was trying and experimenting with a lot of different technologies and frameworks to see which ones suit my interests best. Many frontend sub-branches were very interesting to me, such as interactive and creative showcase websites, WebGL&#8230; But the most interesting aspect was developing complex applications.</p>
<p>Web applications include business logic, communicating with backend solutions, building complex architectures and structures, developing routing management, storing data, designing UI/UX, improving performance, CSS/JS animations and many more. All those elements incited me to specialize on becoming a Web Application Developer, more than a classic Frontend Developer &#8211; I had to think more out of the box and be responsible for much more dependencies than a typical UI developer. It is a perfect merge of creative and logic.</p>
<p>I started experimenting with Angular.js, React.js and Vue.js. I built simple to-do applications with all those frameworks just to get familiar with their environments and the development flow. I won’t talk about what framework is the best one or compare them, because they are all great and have their pros and cons, but Vue.js just intrigued me the most. I had the feeling that Vue contains the best parts from the Angular and the React world, and Vue gave me the biggest satisfaction while developing.</p>
<p><strong>That’s when I decided Vue.js is the framework I want to use and become the best Vue.js developer I could possibly become &#8211; and so my Vue journey started.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4386" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="React, Angular Vue logos - Bornfight Blog" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body01.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<h4>Our first steps with Vue.js</h4>
<p>Excited and enthusiastic about Vue.js, I told the crew at our frontend team that I would love to hold educations about Vue.js, so that we can all learn, discuss and potentially use Vue for some of our next projects. After a couple of education, the team really got into the concept of developing web applications in Vue.js, and so we started implementing it into our projects.</p>
<p>When we started using Vue.js, the main focus was to build the experience and the knowledge in this framework. I started using Vue on simple internal projects like the task manager and the time tracking tool. In the beginning, there was a lot of obstacles and confusion, but that is just an inevitable part of the journey to become a great developer &#8211; regardless of the technology.</p>
<p>When we completed a couple of our first projects, we were definitely sure that Vue.js is without a doubt the framework we should use for bigger and more complex projects.</p>
<h4>Projects in which we used the Vue.js framework</h4>
<p>One of the first projects where we implemented Vue was Vremen.co &#8211; our internal time tracking tool. This was more of an upgrade than a new project, because Vremen.co was already developed with PHP, Yii and vanilla JS. But we wanted our frontend to be more interactive, faster and with better UX/UI, and it was a perfect fit to try Vue.js on a project of that scale and to see what Vue is really capable of.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4387" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4387" class="size-full wp-image-4387" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="Vremen.co dashboard - Vue.js - Bornfight Blog" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body02.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4387" class="wp-caption-text">Vremen.co time tracking tool</p></div></p>
<p>Another very interesting Vue.js project was Mishkat &#8211; an advanced application we developed for a large Saudi Arabian museum. The part that makes this project interesting is that we used a combination of Vue.js, Node.js, Kinect and Electron. And of course, the really amazing design and the overall interactivity of the application.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4388" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4388" class="size-full wp-image-4388" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="Mishkat museum interactive application - Vue.js - Bornfight Blog" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body03.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4388" class="wp-caption-text">Mishkat application</p></div></p>
<p>We also used the Vue.js framework when we developed Markables &#8211; a web application which caters to the needs of valuation professionals from all over the world.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4389" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4389" class="size-full wp-image-4389" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body04.jpg?x22406" alt="Markables application - Vue.js - Bornfight Blog" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body04.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4389" class="wp-caption-text">Markables application</p></div></p>
<p>And the last Vue.js application on this list is actually the first Vue application I have ever built. It’s called Zadat.co and it our internal task manager tool that uses the Teamwork REST-API.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4390" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4390" class="size-full wp-image-4390" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body05.jpg?x22406" alt="Zadat.co task application - Vue.js - Bornfight Blog" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body05.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body05-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4390" class="wp-caption-text">Zadat.co application</p></div></p>
<h4>Starting with Vue.js vs. mastering Vue.js</h4>
<p>Although Vue has an easier and a faster learning curve than other popular JS frameworks, it is not that easy to step into the product and business logic part of frontend for the first few times. It takes a lot of time, effort, patience, experience, learning and ups-and-downs to be able to create a high-quality mid-scale or bigger web applications.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s compare code quality of our first Vue applications with code from some of the latest ones &#8211; we’ll use Vuex store modules for those examples.</p>
<p><strong>With every new application, the level of our code quality gets higher, the syntax gets better, logic gets smarter and the structure better.</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_4392" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4392" class="size-full wp-image-4392" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body07.jpg?x22406" alt="Vuex structure - Vue.js - Bornfight Blog" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body07.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body07-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body07-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4392" class="wp-caption-text">Vuex structure in first Vue application</p></div></p>
<p>In the image above, we see the Vuex store modules structure. This type of structure is not applicable to mid-scale or larger applications because it just isn’t maintainable. The bigger the application gets, the more complex, tangled and unrelated Vuex store would become. We can see that we have modules like assignTask.js, checkTask.js, deleteTask.js, filterTasks.js, getTasklist.js and userTasks.js.</p>
<p><strong>All those modules should actually be one “task” module that manages all of the logic that’s relevant to tasks.</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_4391" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4391" class="size-full wp-image-4391" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body08.jpg?x22406" alt="Vuex structure - Vue.js - Bornfight blog" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body08.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body08-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body08-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_svjetlicic_vue_body08-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4391" class="wp-caption-text">Vuex structure in first Vue application</p></div></p>
<p>On the other hand, in this image we have a very good structure of Vuex modules. Every logic unit (model) has its own store module. Every module is divided into state, getters, mutations and actions &#8211; those are Vuex native keynames and methods, and each of them has a unique role in the Vuex environment. We can also notice that the global AjaxService is used in this type of store modularized structure. AjaxService.ts is the central place for all AJAX requests and management, and that is enabling us more control and maintenance of all HTTP communication with backend on the global level.</p>
<p>I hope you have noticed one more major difference between this image and the first one &#8211; TypeScript. TypeScript provides much better code and syntax quality, especially in web applications where there is a lot more JavaScript logic than in typical showcase websites. I strongly recommend using it over vanilla JS as it will save you a lot of debugging hours.</p>
<p>To close this section, I just want to say that it’s very important not to stay in your comfort zone once you build your first applications &#8211; try new technologies, approaches, libraries… with every new project you start working on. The only way to become a better developer is to try and learn new stuff, because no matter how much you know, there is always room for improvement.</p>
<h4>Vue.js &#8211; yes or no?</h4>
<p>Using Vue.js for the last 2 years was an amazing app development journey. As the world of JavaScript got overcrowded with numerous frameworks and libraries in the last couple of years, choosing Vue.js turned out as an excellent choice for us. We have learned a lot &#8211; not only about Vue, but also about JavaScript, TypeScript, programming patterns, Node.js, server-side environments and a lot of other useful skills. All because we started implementing Vue.js into our application.</p>
<p><strong>The knowledge of Vue gave us so many opportunities to expand and keep on upgrading our programming abilities.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re thinking about using Vue.js for your next project, I recommend it without a doubt. It will enable you to create client-side applications in a way that’s much faster, better and more interesting. And you will quickly feel the progress you’re achieving &#8211; becoming a better developer with every new project. Just as we did.</p>
