										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>If you take a look at award-winning websites, it can be hard to figure out specific internal processes that enable agencies to consistently create amazing end-results.</h3>
<p>However, if you take time to continuously research and &#8216;tune-into&#8217; a specific level of quality of those <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/services/advanced-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative websites</a>, you’ll notice that most of them are very harmonious. Every element, every animation or typography choice is somehow synchronized, and there is an underlying story that makes you feel delighted. You realize that this digital creation has a soul &#8211; a concept.</p>
<p>When we designers use the word concept, we are usually talking about design that is made for fun or practice (and rarely sees the light of the day). While this is not inherently wrong, I would like to define what kind of concepts we&#8217;ll be discussing in this article.</p>
<p>The concepts I&#8217;ll talk about can be defined as sets of emotional attributes (clean, bold, bright) or simple statements whose meaning is apparent throughout your creation. A good example of this would be a <a href="https://ascc.bornfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">case study website</a> we created for one of our projects. It clearly communicates the message that interactive installations have been made for the largest museum in the world. And the concept behind this microsite is simple &#8211; &#8216;big&#8217;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3556" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body01.png?x22406" alt="" width="3250" height="1774" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body01.png 3250w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body01-300x164.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body01-768x419.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body01-1024x559.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3250px) 100vw, 3250px" /></p>
<h4>How to create a strong concept?</h4>
<p>To create a good concept for real-life client projects, we first have to have to tick a few checkboxes.</p>
<h5>Info about a client&#8217;s brand</h5>
<p>Fully understanding what our client&#8217;s brand is about is really useful while you&#8217;re in the process of creating a concept. Ideally, your concept and your client’s brand should work hand in hand or at least not conflict with each other. Developing digital branding for a client alongside a website is an ideal case as it enables you to create a concept that encompasses both the brand and the creative website.</p>
<h5>Website goals</h5>
<p>Everything that&#8217;s being designed needs to be able to solve a problem. In other words, it needs to have a set of defined goals. This is something you can define with a client via a <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/whats-the-big-deal-about-writing-a-website-brief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website brief</a> or by conducting a structured <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/benefits-of-a-product-discovery-workshop-and-why-do-you-need-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workshop</a>.</p>
<h5>Target audience</h5>
<p>A concept is something that should invoke emotion in the user and add a sense of depth to the project. That is why you should really know your audience and have a general idea of how your concept could be received. Think of it as preparing a meal for a friend &#8211; if you know they don&#8217;t like certain types of food, you probably won&#8217;t use them in your meal.</p>
<h5>Draft content</h5>
<p>Why draft? Well, if you&#8217;re working on a project where the client provides the content, it is unrealistic to expect that it will be entirely web-ready right from the get-go. That is why you need to have a designer or someone from your content team to do a content review. Final content will be that aspect that will help make your concept more concrete.</p>
<h4>Let’s do an analysis</h4>
<p>Depending on the brief you received and the provided content, you should be able to list a couple of sentences or words that could form the basis of the concept. Is your website about architecture? Perspective imagery and unusual grid can convey the order and innovative approach.</p>
<p>But, what happens when you have an industry that is not easily visualized? For example, if you work for a client in the financial industry or venture capital industry, there might not be an immediate visual association that would work for the average user. This is a situation when a concept can be described as a series of attributes (as we’ve described before) such as &#8216;trustworthy&#8217;, &#8216;stable&#8217;, &#8216;polished&#8217;, &#8216;serious&#8217;.</p>
<p>Every element you choose from this point onward needs to be in line with those attributes, as they&#8217;ll form a cohesive impression. A good example of this is the <a href="https://omonia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omonia website</a> we designed and developed. As you can see, it doesn&#8217;t have an easily describable concept, but you can see it’s definitely there &#8211; clean, speed, digital, abstract. Every element used is deliberate, from the typeface and layout to the choice of imagery.</p>
<h4>What does the process look like?</h4>
<p>To keep it as direct and clear as possible, I&#8217;ll use one of our latest projects as an example. Here&#8217;s the deal &#8211; a client approached us with and said they wanted us to build a website that would facilitate donations for the reforestation of fire-devastated areas in Dalmatia. The project I&#8217;m talking about is <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/73336419/Paint-It-Back-Interactive-Digital-Forest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boranka</a>, the largest reforestation campaign in Croatia.</p>
<p>Their campaign started by collecting the ashes of burnt trees to create crayons that can be used to draw a tree. The drawing of the tree would then be uploaded via our website and it would motivate users to attach a small donation in addition to uploading a drawing.</p>
<h5>1. Brainstorming for a concept</h5>
<p>There were quite a lot of possible ways to approaches this project, so we gathered the whole team that worked on the project to contribute with their own ideas. This included back-end developers, front-end developers, designers and experts from our strategic partnerships department.</p>
<p>After the brainstorming session, we agreed upon a concept &#8211; we’re going to build a 3D forest. We even came up with a rough user flow we could iterate later on, in order to make sure we covered every edge case.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3557" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body02.png?x22406" alt="" width="2754" height="1406" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body02.png 2754w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body02-300x153.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body02-768x392.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body02-1024x523.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2754px) 100vw, 2754px" /></p>
<h5>2. Defining a final user flow and wireframes</h5>
<p>Even though this was imagined as a creative website, it did have some specific tasks it needed to accomplish &#8211; it needed to facilitate donations that will help finance the process of reforestation. That goal is why we integrated an external payment service to support donations from a technical aspect.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3558" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body03.png?x22406" alt="" width="4516" height="2326" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body03.png 4516w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body03-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body03-768x396.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body03-1024x527.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 4516px) 100vw, 4516px" /></p>
<p>That being said, donations were not mandatory for users as we didn’t want to prevent them from planting a tree, but we did entice them to donate so that particular tree they planted in our virtual forest would also be planted in the real forest in Dalmatia.</p>
<p>To help our front end-developers, we designers created a set of wireframes for the website as it needed a bit more details that would set the foundation for the prototype.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3559" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body04.png?x22406" alt="" width="1193" height="788" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body04.png 1193w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body04-300x198.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body04-768x507.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body04-1024x676.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1193px) 100vw, 1193px" /></p>
<h5>3. Moodboard and art direction</h5>
<p>At the same time, we also worked on the visual look and feel of the website. By defining a moodboard, we based our approach around simple tree models in the virtual space.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3560" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body05.png?x22406" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body05.png 2880w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body05-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body05-768x432.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body05-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /></p>
<p>From that point onward, we started creating early versions of UI elements, so our front-end developers could build a prototype with a higher fidelity. We did this as it would enable us to do some more fine tuning during the production phase.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3561" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body06.png?x22406" alt="" width="2879" height="1619" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body06.png 2879w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body06-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body06-768x432.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body06-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2879px) 100vw, 2879px" /></p>
<p>You’ll notice that all those micro decisions are guided by a simple concept &#8211; let’s make a 3D forest where you can plant your trees in. Having a concept defined right from the start keeps everybody anchored to a common understanding, and it also makes all decision-making much easier because of a well-defined direction.</p>
<h5>4. Building a prototype</h5>
<p>As soon as we agreed on the initial concept (which also included a rough flow and basic wireframes), front-end development started working on the prototype. Prototyping is an excellent way to reduce the chance of encountering any kinds of risks later in the project risks and allows us to tackle unknown tech difficulties. In this particular case, front-end developers needed to test the process of importing and displaying pre-made tree models. They also used the prototype to sync the color scheme with the previously defined art direction.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3562" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body07.png?x22406" alt="" width="2880" height="1598" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body07.png 2880w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body07-300x166.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body07-768x426.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body07-1024x568.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /></p>
<h5>5. Fine tune &amp; polish</h5>
<p>This phase is a collaboration phase, and it&#8217;s a bit different than the one that usually occurs during your traditional website-building process. For this phase, we had designers and developers sit together in a couple of short feedback sessions whose goal was to nail down element placement, animation eases, performance optimizations&#8230; After those sessions, developers continued with their part of the project, and our designers went on to work on missing assets and other visual modifications that would be incorporated into the finished website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3563" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body08.png?x22406" alt="" width="2646" height="1768" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body08.png 2646w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body08-300x200.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body08-768x513.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body08-1024x684.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2646px) 100vw, 2646px" /></p>
<p>The concept we defined in the beginning was extremely helpful here, as it guided us through the process of creation of all small UI elements. Every single element of the website can be connected with forest theme, and this reinforces the concept even further.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3564" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body09.png?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1064" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body09.png 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body09-300x166.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body09-768x426.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_simic_creative_website_body09-1024x567.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>A concept is the basis of innovation</h4>
<p>I always say this because concepts are grounded in an idea rather than any particular medium (web, film, print or anything else). Before I end, I just want you to keep this thought in mind before you start working on your next project &#8211; strong creative concepts are sometimes easier to feel rather than describe with words.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope this gave you some insight into how web concepts work and how they can tie everything together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A short summary of the most important steps you need to take if you’re applying for a design job.</h3>
<p>__________</p>
<p>Want to join our design team? Check out our open positions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bornfight.com/careers/mobile-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobile Designer (M/F)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>__________</p>
<p>Finding the right candidate for a design job can sometimes be a real challenge. There are a lot of aspects that need to be covered, but your initial presentation is crucial. As a Design Director at Bornfight, I receive a lot of portfolios and open letters on a weekly basis, but a lot of those applications are not satisfactory because designers <strong>don’t present themselves and their work in a right way</strong>. This is actually the reason I chose to write this post — to help you out by describing how to find the right job and properly present yourself and your work.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3355" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>Set your goals</h4>
<p>First and most important — ask yourself what you want to do and <strong>what is your passion</strong>. If you are not sure, the first step can be finding someone who is already working in an agency and <strong>talking to the people from this profession</strong>. That will give you a much clearer vision about the direction you should go.</p>
<p>‘Where Do You See Yourself in Five Years?’ — that’s the question you’ll be asked on every interview you go on, but the thing is, <strong>you need to know the answer to that question especially for yourself</strong>. Be sure to know what you want to do in your life and focus on it, as that will make planning your future much easier.</p>
<p>Make sure you <strong>build your career in an environment you can thrive in</strong>. In the long run, people who surround you will be the ones that really affect your career. Try to <strong>find a job in an environment where people have similar passions</strong> and love what they do, connect with that kind of people and you’ll have a bright career in front of you.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3356" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bornfight_blog_grubisic_design_job_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>Work on your portfolio</h4>
<p>With your portfolio, you are making the first impression—it&#8217;s the thing your potential employer will look at first. Work hard to make an impression and <strong>showcase a few projects you are most proud of</strong>. Remember, you present yourself and your way of thinking through a portfolio, so <strong>make sure every detail is perfect</strong>.</p>
<p>Try to avoid .pdf portfolios and Dropbox folders with screenshots of your designs, especially if you&#8217;re applying for a job at a digital company — there are a bunch of great <strong>simple online services that can help you easily build your own portfolio</strong> (<a href="https://readymag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Readymag</a>, <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squarespace</a>, <a href="https://www.semplice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semplice</a> are a few great options).</p>
<p>As a designer, always <strong>attempt to solve the problems through your projects</strong>. Talk about the approach and process you had while working on them. Consider a few things when sending your portfolio:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the background behind your project?</li>
<li>What problem do you want to solve?</li>
<li>What are the goals of the project?</li>
<li>Who are the users you design for?</li>
<li>How are you planning to solve problems on that project?</li>
</ul>
<p>Design is not about making things beautiful, it’s about using the right process and storytelling to create a solution. Do not prioritize screenshot aesthetics over functional utility.</p>
<p>I’ve heard designers who were trying to find a job for the first time <strong>complain they don’t have any work to show</strong> because they didn’t have an opportunity to work on real projects. Don’t stress yourself with having no experience of working in an agency or with clients, or not having any work to show. I am sure you know of some website or a tool you use every day, but you had a bad experience using it.</p>
<p>Make an improvement, see what’s wrong with the design, try to find something better and present your approach by resolving that problem.</p>
<p>Take care of your portfolio, consider all current technologies and design for that technologies. In the end, show the things you are best at, and include those you would actually like to work on.</p>

<h4>Prepare for the interview</h4>
<p><strong>Research the company</strong> before you come to the interview. Do research on the people who already work there and find designers from that company on social media. You’ll find a lot of useful information that can help you, and you’ll also learn a thing or two from the people who already have experience in working there. Also, don’t forget to research clients the company is working for and the projects they have done.</p>
<p>Be ready to <strong>present and discuss your work</strong>. Critiques will help you broaden your communication skills as a designer, as there is always the opportunity to articulate why you did what you did or to better explain your idea to the reviewer, if they don’t see it as clearly as you do.</p>
<p><strong>Being honest during the interview</strong> is maybe the most important part of all. Remember, we all have pros and cons, so feel free to communicate them.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Explore different companies, their websites and their social profiles — there you’ll find about what they do, about people and culture inside the company. Attend design meetups where you&#8217;ll have a chance to meet and talk with people from the industry— you&#8217;ll get a vision and a feeling of how it is to work in different companies. Stay fresh with your portfolio work and be aware of current trends in digital design—not just when you are applying for a job, but all the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Awwwards panel awarded the GETZ website with Site of the Day, Honors, Mobile Excellence and the Developer Award.</h3>
<p>We designed and developed the <a href="https://www.mariodragicevic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GETZ website</a> in order to showcase the work of Mario Dragičević, a photographer and videographer from Zagreb. This website was created to serve as Mario’s personal portfolio, so we placed a big emphasis on showcasing photo galleries containing his finest work. As Mario mostly works with clients in the fashion industry and is specialized in portrait photography, the entire website is built around those two large photo categories, and in that way caters to the main type of clients Mario usually works with.</p>
<div style="padding: 70% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/329534540?autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>To explore <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/78126653/GETZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how the website was designed and developed</a>, we sat down with our Front-end Development Team Lead Karlo Videk and Design Director Hrvoje Grubišić who spearheaded the project.</p>
<h4>What are you most proud of?</h4>
<p><strong>KARLO:</strong> I’d say we are most proud of the extremely smooth interactions we created and implemented across the entire website. This enabled us to increase the overall user experience on the web and made it more seamless.</p>
<p><strong>HRVOJE:</strong> Another benefit of this is that it introduced a level of novelty that made the website more immersive and, most importantly, interesting to use and navigate through.</p>
<h4>What challenges did you need to solve?</h4>
<p><strong>HRVOJE:</strong> Well, the website needed to feel and be as fluid as possible, so the most important challenge we needed to solve was fast loading and preloading of media assets. In addition to that, we had a lot of work polishing all of the micro-interactions on the website, as well as those special animations that occur on mouse hold.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2978" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_awwwards_body01-1.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="780" height="550" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_awwwards_body01-1.jpg 780w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_awwwards_body01-1-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_awwwards_body01-1-768x542.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><strong>KARLO:</strong> Another thing that proved to be a bit challenging was triggering custom page transitions upon ending user interaction. You see, as the website is filled with a variety of transitions that occur between list views and gallery views, we really had to pay special attention to make them seamless and streamlined.</p>
<h4>Were there any hiccups during the process?</h4>
<p><strong>KARLO:</strong> There actually weren’t any hiccups because we planned the entire process upfront. The process and the approach we decided to follow and implement were clear from the beginning, and we had a precise vision of what we wanted to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>HRVOJE:</strong> During the initial phases of the project, we prototyped and communicated quite a lot, so the end product is actually an improved version of the prototypes we created in the beginning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Even though this was a smaller project, we really put a lot into it. We polished every element, every animation and every transition to make it as smooth to use as we initially envisioned it, so I’m more than happy that the website got the awards.&#8221; &#8211; Karlo Videk / Front-end Development Team Lead</strong></p>
<h4>Tell us more about the navigation structure?</h4>
<p><strong>HRVOJE:</strong> Well, what we wanted to achieve is a flat navigation structure. In the beginning, it is represented through a slider that enables users to enter a gallery. When users are already in a gallery, they can go to the next one by interacting with the navigation element that’s placed on the bottom of the page. We also went the extra mile and implemented a horizontal diagonal navigation. By doing that, we added to the dynamics of the placed content, but also connected that feeling to the effect of moving a camera during the photoshoot.</p>
<h4>What about the technology behind the web?</h4>
<p><strong>KARLO:</strong> We used the ES6 JavaScript version and standard in the front-end, and Barba.js was used for PJAX transitions between pages. We created a majority of the animations with the GreenSock animation platform, while others were implemented by using CSS3 transitions. On the back-end part, we used WordPress, and that enables us to edit every single detail regarding the content (media and text) through the content management system.</p>
<h4>What special features did you implement?</h4>
<p><strong>HRVOJE:</strong> One of the special features we implemented are most certainly those click &amp; hold interactions. They are not only interactive, but they also enabled us to prefetch the next page just by hovering on the CTA element &#8211; both in the list view and the single gallery view. The next page is fully loaded after the hold animation on the CTA element finishes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2980" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_awwwards_body02-1.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="780" height="550" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_awwwards_body02-1.jpg 780w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_awwwards_body02-1-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_awwwards_body02-1-768x542.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<h4>Is there anything else you really focused on?</h4>
<p><strong>KARLO:</strong> There were a number of things, but I have to single out the large amount of focus we put on mobile optimization. Because of that, the entire website on mobile is as smooth, seamless and streamlined as it is on desktop. Also, this resulted in a Mobile Excellence award by Awwwards, so I’d say we did a really good job.</p>
<h4>Did you learn anything new?</h4>
<p><strong>HRVOJE:</strong> Well, we learned that even smaller, simpler websites and projects can be extremely creative, eye pleasing and interesting to work on.</p>
<p><strong>KARLO:</strong> It’s all about the mindset you have when you enter the project. Everything lies in that mindset of the creators, their vision and common goals.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2935" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_interview.png?x22406" alt="" width="1793" height="870" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_interview.png 1793w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_interview-300x146.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_interview-768x373.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bornfight_blog_getz_interview-1024x497.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1793px) 100vw, 1793px" /></p>
<h4>And the awards, or should we say Awwwards?</h4>
<p><strong>HRVOJE:</strong> Oh yeah, that’s the real icing on the cake. <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/getz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We got all four</a> &#8211; the Site of the Day, Honors, Mobile Excellence and Developer Award. I have to say it&#8217;s amazing when your work is recognized by the experts, especially the Awwwards panel that’s really top notch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Last week we attended the Digital Lab.in conference that took place in Labin, Croatia. It turned out to be a great team building.</h3>
<p>We came back inspired and full of fresh perspectives. This is the first year for Digital Lab.in organizers, and we can only say &#8211; great job guys!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2142" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/joni.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/joni.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/joni-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/joni-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/joni-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<h4>Lectures, workshops, both or none</h4>
<p>The conference had two parts &#8211; <strong>workshops and lectures</strong>. Since we were a bit short on time, we skipped the workshops, but the great thing is that we didn’t skip the lectures.</p>
<p>The schedule was pretty tight, so we attended 9 presentations from 9:30 to 18:00. The lecturers were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Daan Klaver (Build in Amsterdam)</li>
<li>Henry Daubrez (Dogstudio)</li>
<li>Vitaly Friedman (Smashing magazine)</li>
<li>Krešimir Mudrovčić (Five)</li>
<li>Emanuel Miličević (Infinum)</li>
<li>Mario Šestak (Bornfight)</li>
<li>Vlatko Vlahek (Prototyp)</li>
<li>Ivan Lučin (Productive)</li>
<li>Marko Plovanić (Infosit)</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2143" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/place.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/place.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/place-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/place-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/place-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<h4>First Runners and Mind Blowers</h4>
<p>Now that we had some time to digest everything we heard, it’s a bit easier to make a list of all the highlights.</p>
<p>We started the day with <strong>Daan Klaver from Build in Amsterdam</strong>. He set a really high standard for the other guys (just saying what everyone was thinking <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) with the presentation <strong>“12 principles to create great e-commerce”</strong>.</p>
<p>This was so much more than just tips &amp; tricks, it was pure wisdom on how to set your mind to make the best job you can. Out of respect for you readers, I won’t kill you with transcripts (there’s a link to a video with all the presentations at the end of the article), but I will however highlight a few points that got me excited:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your skills are your authority in the team, not your titles</li>
<li>It is important to share the vision with your clients, they should always be partners</li>
<li>Take a nap</li>
<li>Don’t pitch projects</li>
</ol>
<p>I intentionally won’t give away any &#8220;whys&#8221;, just to get you to watch the presentation. As I said, the link is at the end of this post. You will love it!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2144" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/daan.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/daan.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/daan-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/daan-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/daan-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<p>We also saw some good shit &#8211; they think, design and develop brands, as well as digital products and experiences that look good, work great and feel amazing. <strong>Henry Daubrez from Dogstudio</strong> showed us how to think and act if designing wonderful digital experiences is our goal.</p>
<p>Modify, duplicate, modify, duplicate… and design something to be <strong>the next blockbuster</strong>. Why? Watch the video. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2145" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/henry.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/henry.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/henry-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/henry-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/henry-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<p><strong>Vitaly Friedman</strong> really made my day. I liked that he is a guy with unlimited amount of great examples to great points. I did find myself thinking &#8220;<strong>I’m not doing this quirky UI enough, this is great&#8221;</strong>. He said, do your design &#8220;just a little bit off&#8221; and &#8220;take the most boring element on the page and make it great&#8221;. Those were such great points, I had to share them with you.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2146" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vitaly.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vitaly.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vitaly-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vitaly-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vitaly-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<p>The thing that perfectly sums up this presentation is in one of the notes I wrote down while Vitaly was on the stage &#8211; &#8220;<strong>he really put a smile on every face in the room&#8221;</strong>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4>Bornfight takes center stage</h4>
<p>Bornfight’s entire design and frontend teams, as well as Degordian’s creative team came to support <strong>our head of design &#8211; Mario Šestak</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2147" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_3.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_3.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_3-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Bringing ideas to life&#8221;</strong> &#8211; I was so happy he decided to hold this presentation. As a part of his team, I now truly understand how important it is to know what we (designers, developers, creators) have to do when it comes to <strong>creating digital experiences</strong>. And what our role as starting points in that process is.</p>
<p>It’s all about learning to improve &#8211; about <strong>starting from ourselves and asking &#8220;what could I do better&#8221;</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2148" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_1.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_1.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maki_1-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<p>In addition to the personal effort we put into building our professional careers, what really makes my day is a statistical coincidence (I call this “a life freebie”) that, out of all the companies, we ended up in the same one, and that I get to learn from him every day.</p>
<h4>What else did we get to see?</h4>
<p>This conference covered three key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>App development</li>
<li>Front-end</li>
<li>Design</li>
</ol>
<p>There were a couple of product and app-oriented presentations. <strong>Ivan Lučin</strong> gave us his insights on building SaaS products, while <strong>Krešimir Mudrovčić</strong> gave us a project manager’s perspective on validating information needed to run a good app project.</p>
<p><strong>Emanuel Miličević from Infinum</strong> had some excellent ideas about personalizing interactions to user needs, as well as focusing on people with limited senses and their everyday needs.</p>
<p><strong>Vlatko Vlahek</strong> had a 40 minute lecture about service workers. Since I’m a specialized digital designer, I had to check my intuition with our front-end crew (shout out), and they confirmed to me that Vlatko really <strong>sold us on the idea of service workers</strong>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Marko Plovanić</strong> finished the presentation part of the conference with a great presentation about <strong>design thinking principles</strong> in web design and UX. And you really can’t repeat those enough!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2149" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vlatko.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vlatko.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vlatko-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vlatko-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/vlatko-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<p>When all this great presentations ended, we had one panel discussion with <strong>Marko Mišulić</strong> (CEO Rentlio), <strong>Antonio Perić</strong> (CEO Locastic), <strong>Krešimir Končić</strong> (CEO Neurolab) and <strong>Tomislav Grubišić</strong> (CEO Bornfight). The topic of the panel was &#8220;<strong>What Tech CEOs Want From Croatia&#8217;s Best Tech Talent&#8221;</strong>. This was a really good mix of CEOs because of their company backgrounds. Products, agencies, small companies and big ones &#8211; we had all of it in one place. They all talked about attracting new people, and what they’re looking for in potential employees. They were also aware that <strong>being a good mentor to your mentee is the most valuable long term investment</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2150" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tompa.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tompa.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tompa-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tompa-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tompa-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<p>It was clear that everyone has quite similar business challenges, regardless of the company size, field of business orientation. You can create products or run an agency, but <strong>you still have people working for you</strong> &#8211; you want to develop them to be top professionals and you want to keep them in your companies.</p>
<p>I was happy to see that <strong>culture and mentorship were the main focus</strong>, and I felt good seeing that people nowadays realize these are the most valuable starting points needed to create good companies.</p>
<p>Beside that, I’m always excited when others get the chance to listen to our CEO Tompa, and suck in the wisdom.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2151" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/crew_2.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1050" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/crew_2.jpg 1050w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/crew_2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/crew_2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/crew_2-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Building a digital product isn’t a simple thing. This is not necessarily because of the number of planned features, or the need for it to perform well in various cases. It’s mostly because we have a fairly limited insight of how users interact with our product. So, what happens when the user is you?</h3>
<p>There is a saying that you’re your own worst client. While I can see how that can be true for some people, let’s just take moment and think about the benefits here: all of those small (or big) frustrations you have can now be addressed (by yourself, no less!), so you can use your digital product like it’s meant to be used. There is a name for this, too; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dogfooding</a>.</p>
<p>Dogfooding can easily expose flaws in your process, but it can also improve it by making obvious which efforts give you the most return. So the benefits of this are twofold; you can solve internal challenges with a digital product, but it’s also an opportunity to work on your process and see the results almost immediately. Talk about putting your money where your mouth is, right?</p>
<h4>Defining the Problem</h4>
<p>So, we have this internal tool called Vremen.co. It was an internal effort from our development team, created to track time in order to keep project profitability in check and see how accurate our project estimates actually are.</p>
<p>Although it worked pretty good, the tool hasn’t been touched by a designer during its development, so it needed some UX/UI love.</p>
<div id="attachment_1092" style="width: 1547px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1092" class="size-full wp-image-1092" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vremenco_old.png" alt="" width="1537" height="817" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vremenco_old.png 1537w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vremenco_old-300x159.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vremenco_old-768x408.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vremenco_old-1024x544.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1537px) 100vw, 1537px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1092" class="wp-caption-text">Old version of Vremen.co</p></div>
<p>We tested the tool, and while some of the bugs could be fixed, there were some non-critical usability issues that slowed users down. For example, I am a big fan of keyboard-only operation, and it bothered me that it was faster to use my mouse to input time tracking than any other way. This is not a big issue, but if you attempt to be very precise on your time inputs while working on many small projects, you’ll get frustrated real quick.</p>
<div id="attachment_1093" style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1093" class="wp-image-1093 size-full" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/frustration.gif" alt="" width="288" height="162" /><p id="caption-attachment-1093" class="wp-caption-text">Me after inputting a lot of tasks</p></div>
<p>So, the main problem we were solving was the large amount of effort to input a task. This was disruptive to the <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flow</a> of the work we were usually doing.</p>
<div id="attachment_1091" style="width: 1318px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1091" class="size-full wp-image-1091" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/input-field-vremenco.png" alt="" width="1308" height="1234" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/input-field-vremenco.png 1308w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/input-field-vremenco-300x283.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/input-field-vremenco-768x725.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/input-field-vremenco-1024x966.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1308px) 100vw, 1308px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1091" class="wp-caption-text">Old input form</p></div>
<h4>Analysing the Current State and Fixing the Flow</h4>
<p>Logging time is one of the main actions in Vremen.co, so it made sense to focus most of our attention on optimizing that part of the tool. We analysed the current form to find out what the pain points are, and this is what we got:</p>
<div id="attachment_1090" style="width: 549px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1090" class="size-full wp-image-1090" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/old-form-actions.png" alt="" width="539" height="611" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/old-form-actions.png 539w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/old-form-actions-265x300.png 265w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1090" class="wp-caption-text">10 steps required to input a single task</p></div>
<p>There were some additional pain points that were slowing down the input: using the “tab” key on keyboard defocused the whole form, which required refocusing with the mouse. Also, there was no keyboard way to focus on a previous field, once again requiring that the user use his mouse.</p>
<p>We realized that by using some small helpers (like autofocusing the next required field) we can speed up the whole interaction and reduce the mental load on the user.</p>
<div id="attachment_1094" style="width: 948px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1094" class="size-full wp-image-1094" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/form-action-comparison-autofocus.png" alt="" width="938" height="565" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/form-action-comparison-autofocus.png 938w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/form-action-comparison-autofocus-300x181.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/form-action-comparison-autofocus-768x463.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1094" class="wp-caption-text">User steps optimized with autofocus</p></div>
<p>Some of our colleagues preferred mouse operation, but autofocusing the next field will give them some time-saving benefit anyway.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s Next?</h4>
<p>We properly implemented basic form accessibility so we can use a keyboard to “tab” between various form fields. But since some of them are optional, we thought it would be a nice idea to be able to skip them automatically via keyboard shortcut, to save more time.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we introduced a dedicated key combination to skip time input and note field so the users can directly create a task, which speeds up the interaction even more.</p>
<div id="attachment_1088" style="width: 1295px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1088" class="size-full wp-image-1088" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/form-action-comparison-autofocus-shortcuts.png" alt="" width="1285" height="611" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/form-action-comparison-autofocus-shortcuts.png 1285w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/form-action-comparison-autofocus-shortcuts-300x143.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/form-action-comparison-autofocus-shortcuts-768x365.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/form-action-comparison-autofocus-shortcuts-1024x487.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1285px) 100vw, 1285px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1088" class="wp-caption-text">User steps optimized with autofocus and optional field skipping</p></div>
<h4>It&#8217;s Not &#8220;Just&#8221; a Form</h4>
<p>As you might imagine, this becomes a bit complicated for implementation, since forms like this can produce a lot of weird edge cases that need to be handled from a front-end development standpoint.</p>
<p>However, this also means that every good interaction carries a fixed amount of complexity. It is up to us whether that complexity is carried over to the user for him to handle, or we “hide” it by addressing it in the code. This also gives us a chance to make the whole tool usage a delightful experience. This is how it looks now:</p>
<div id="attachment_1168" style="width: 1180px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1168" class="wp-image-1168 size-full" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vremenco-capture.gif" alt="" width="1170" height="728" /><p id="caption-attachment-1168" class="wp-caption-text">New version of Vremen.co</p></div>
<p>We also had in mind the users that were quite used to the old version of Vremen.co, meaning we didn’t unnecessarily force them to learn new interactions (such as a keyboard-only operation).</p>
<p>I realize this is not the whole story, and we’ll continue to listen to the feedback we’re getting from users, which will help us optimize Vremen.co further and even come up with new features over time.</p>
<p>That being said, while making these kinds of changes in products, it’s vital to identify places where the changes would make the biggest impact. Not all features in digital products are being used to the same extent, meaning we run the risk of investing a lot of time fixing a rarely used feature.<br />
This is what we’ve done right in case of Vremen.co: we identified the most used functionality and fixed what bothered us about it, improving the tool greatly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>As someone who made only “regular size” screens, I’ve quickly learned that designing for a big touchable surface was quite a different experience from any other project.</h3>
<p>As soon as you put together your first paper prototype on a similarly sized table, you suddenly realize that you have a different set of challenges that you usually deal with. Then again, who doesn’t love a good challenge?</p>
<p>Let’s make something for a large touchscreen. Okay, how difficult can it be – you take a standard size screen and make everything bigger, right? You probably already know it’s not that simple (otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this article right now). There are a lot of factors to consider, so let’s see what conclusions I’ve drawn from the project that included creating a game for a door sized screen.</p>
<h4>Think About the Context</h4>
<p>To make something meaningful, you always need to consider the context and how will the project ultimately be used. This is something that is actually easier because large screens fit in the “not-so-portable” category of devices (unlike smartphones or tablets). This means that you can familiarise yourself with the environment that this device will be placed in. Will that place be outdoor or somewhere inside? What are the lighting conditions? By asking these types of questions, we try to get as much information about the environment as possible. Get a feeling for it, imagine yourself standing there and using it – it will influence what and how you’re presenting stuff on the screen.</p>
<h4>Consider the Users</h4>
<p>Let’s say you have a large screen placed as a low table in the middle of the room. A kid walks in and starts tapping. And then you realize that this goofy toddler is unable to reach most of the buttons (that you placed out of reach) and starts crying, and causing s lot of drama in the process. You wake up in cold sweat and start revising your UI… ok, I went a bit too far here, but you get the point. Know who you’re designing for. Touchscreen interactives have relatively simple interactions, meaning they will appeal to a broad range of users, some of which may have limited physical capabilities (like small children or people with disabilities).</p>
<h4>Your Users Will Leave</h4>
<p>Just like with mobile applications or web pages, you can expect that users will not feel any obligation to finish all actions they started. Unlike mobile devices, your touchscreen will most like be a “public” device, meaning users can leave in the middle of the action, and leave the application in an “unfinished” state for the next user.</p>
<div id="attachment_1049" style="width: 1004px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1049" class="wp-image-1049 size-full" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/flowpathexample-994x1024.png" alt="" width="994" height="1024" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/flowpathexample-994x1024.png 994w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/flowpathexample-994x1024-291x300.png 291w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/flowpathexample-994x1024-768x791.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1049" class="wp-caption-text">User flow example</p></div>
<p>Planning your application’s flow must reflect that—each screen needs to have a clear set of easy-to-learn controls, so a new user can pick up where the previous left off (or even better, restart the application). This can be partially mitigated by implementing a timeout screen which will restart the app after some idle time.</p>
<h4>Know Your Hardware</h4>
<p>On web-based projects, UI designers usually do not need to worry about hardware too much (with a few exceptions like resolution or good colour reproduction). This changes now as differences between similarly sized screens can be great. Here is a real-life example – some touchscreens have implemented capacitive technology meaning you can trigger interactions using your finger, but not with your glove. It’s the same tech you have in your smartphone. Reliable, but pretty expensive for large screens.</p>
<p>Other touchscreens are just normal screens with an invisible infrared grid in front of it (touch frame as they call it). As you disrupt that grid with your fingers, screen knows where that happened and registers this as a touch.</p>
<div id="attachment_1050" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1050" class="wp-image-1050 size-full" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/knowyourhardware-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/knowyourhardware-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/knowyourhardware-1024x683-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/knowyourhardware-1024x683-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1050" class="wp-caption-text">Similar screens often use different underlying technologies</p></div>
<p>Don’t worry, you don’t need to be tech-savvy to know this upfront, you can learn how a screen works by simply using it and seeing how it behaves. Just a quick note – touch frame screens don’t play too well with multitouch in some cases. It’s something to bear in mind if you’re designing complex multiplayer interactions.</p>
<h4>Indicate That the Screen Is Actually Touchable</h4>
<p>Interestingly, touch screen interactive needs to “say” that it can be interacted with. Why? <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/very-large-touchscreen-ux-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Because it tends to remind some people of TV</a>, which does not encourage people to try them out. Although a bit funny, this makes perfect sense as there is no physical difference between regular screens and touch screens. This is where you, dear designer, come in, it’s up to you to fix that. Various gesture icons within the UI or even the placement of the touchscreen can be of great help when indicating that screen is, in fact, interactive. For example, if we lay the screen at a 45° angle, this resembles a “control console” user might make use of.</p>
<h4>Field of View and Attention</h4>
<p>This is an interesting one. No matter the screen size, we almost always operate with a touchscreen at arms-length, which means that parts of the screen (or separate screen for multi-screen apps) can go well beyond our field of view.</p>
<p><strong>In this case, you have 2 options:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Put important elements in users ‘field of view so they can be easily observed and touched</li>
<li>Use animation to divert attention to key elements on the screen</li>
</ol>
<div id="attachment_1052" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1052" class="wp-image-1052 size-full" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fieldofviewandattention-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fieldofviewandattention-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fieldofviewandattention-1024x683-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fieldofviewandattention-1024x683-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1052" class="wp-caption-text">A user might miss things on screen that are located on the edge of their field of view</p></div>
<p>In my experience, the first method is always the preferable one as users do not need to move their heads or hands too much. By doing this, you can reduce the amount of activity that’s needed because large touchscreens <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/large-touchscreens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">require extra physical effort</a> to operate.</p>
<p>The second method needs some forward thinking because, as you divert attention to a certain part of the screen, you have to ensure that nothing important happens in the other parts. Users don’t have a complete overview of the whole screen real estate as they would on a mobile device or a computer screen, so they might miss some of the messages you’re trying to convey.</p>
<h4>Performers Delight</h4>
<p>The whole point of having a large touchscreen is to display something impressive, especially if users have the influence or control of the application that runs on it. This is something your users will like a lot because a large touch screen can easily attract some audience due to its size. By making said application animated, responsive and impressive to look at, we can make users feel powerful and competent. That’s something we’re going for here, right?</p>
<h4>Size Is Not a Resolution</h4>
<p>Now, you’re sitting at your fancy table designing an app that will be displayed on a large touchscreen. You’re pushing those elements around and set that zoom to 100% so you can see if anything is out of place. It’s a totally legit method for seeing how the element works in a larger context, but it does not give you the whole picture. The reason? Screen size.</p>
<p>This is the exact same reason why mobile designers use mirroring apps to get the exact feeling on how their UI will perform in real conditions. While it might not be viable to hook your Mac on an 84” screen (although, that would be insanely awesome), you can test your designs and see how touchable areas scale compared to the design on your monitor. Hardware plays a big role here as a 55” screen can be either 4k or 1080p, and that will greatly impact the sizing of your cool buttons.</p>

<p>Hopefully, with this newly acquired knowledge, you’ll be more prepared for projects that go beyond standard devices we use every day. Bookmark this article, love it, cherish it, someday it might save you from a headache or two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>One of the main problems in today’s busy and distracting life that constantly shows up is “I have ideas, but I don’t have the time”.</h3>
<p>If we think about that “problem” from a design perspective and place it in agency surrounding we can formulate that phrase as “I don’t have enough time to make an awesome project” or “I don’t have the time to work on personal projects and experiment”. So how to fix that and incorporate your ideas into projects you are working on? We’ll show you how we do it in our design team.</p>
<h4>Time Is Not the Enemy</h4>
<p>In most projects, contrary to standard beliefs, time is not the main problem. It’s the lack of communication and understanding between teammates and/or clients which can lead to a lack of motivation and ideas.</p>
<p>Some of our most successful projects are the ones in which we managed to retain an excellent level of communication with the client and within our team. We try to establish that by talking about the problems as soon as they appear and not sweeping them under the carpet. Shit happens, take responsibility, ask for help, fix it and move on. If you have an amazing idea but you need more time for the implementation, just say it, we’ll try to figure out something.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t over-analyze the situation, ain’t nobody got time for that. Focus on upgrading your communication skills and talk about your problems.</strong></p>
<h4>Discuss Your Ideas</h4>
<p>To be constantly aware of what’s going on in our team we decided to create weekly design meetings. Every Friday at 8:30 am we discuss our ideas, problems, current projects and ways to improve the quality of our work. But sometimes, since we have a lot of sleepyheads on our team, we start a bit later. We try to be as flexible as we can by having in mind that you can’t plan every second of your daily schedule. Besides that, we also have some “emergency” meetings if we have a problem that needs to be solved asap.</p>
<h4><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-549" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/loader-big-7.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="900" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/loader-big-7.jpg 1440w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/loader-big-7-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/loader-big-7-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/loader-big-7-1024x640.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><br />
Meeting With Our Departments</h4>
<p>By trying to break out the classic all-Mondays-are-a-disaster, we created our own Motivational Monday. This is a relaxed version of the design meeting where we stay after work in our lounge and talk about hot and fresh things that are happening currently in the company or in the design and tech world. Our Motivational Mondays are often open to other employees so everyone who is interested can participate. It’s always helpful to hear a different perspective from other teams and see the subject from their point of view.</p>
<h4>Self-Initiated Projects</h4>
<p>During one of our weekly meetings, somebody mentioned the May 1st reboot. It’s a global event of collectively relaunching websites at the same time. While we were talking about that – an idea came to mind. Let’s team up with our frontend developers and join the relaunch. None of us really had the time for another project. But did we try to do it anyway? Of course, we did.</p>
<p>As soon as the meeting ended, we went to our developers with the idea and they were all interested. The next move was to create a team that would consist of one designer and one front-end developer. Every designer needed to design two personal portfolio pages – one for himself and one for the frontend developer, and frontend developers needed to bring the designs to life. We wrote the names of our fronted developers on a piece of paper and threw them in an old hat that was hanging in our office. Designers then drew the names from the hat and formed a team with the lucky frontend developer whose name they pulled out of the hat. Pretty old school, I know, but that was the only use we could think of for that ugly hat.</p>
<p>Here is some of the work we did in collaboration with our lovely front-end developers:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1220 alignnone" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/03_body_photo_igor-bumba-personal-website-by-mario_sestak-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>You Can Never Be Overeducated</h4>
<p>To be able to create a killer project you need to be constantly aware of new technologies and possibilities that can be incorporated into your workflow. But you can’t do it if you think about it only from a design perspective. That’s why we, as a company and as a team, have a strong focus on education in general.</p>
<p>Although we already had design educations every Thursday we decided to team up (again) with our frontend developers and establish design-frontend educations where we go through new tools that can help us improve our communication or enable us to do awesome things better and in less time. This is also a good opportunity to talk about the complexity of implementing certain design elements into our projects. Some things that look simple from the design perspective can be really complicated in development and those are the things that need to be talked about or tested in personal projects and experiments outside daily work. It’s always exciting when you figure out that you can actually use some of the crazy ideas from your personal project on a real one you are working on in an agency.</p>
<h4>The Mindset and Surrounding</h4>
<p>Not all projects in the May 1st reboot managed to come to life but that doesn’t even matter. The most valuable thing we learned was that we need to constantly try to incorporate personal projects into our schedule. Most people are so used to saying “I don’t have the time” they don’t even think twice about it. But, do you really think that others have?</p>
<p><strong>Surround yourself with passionate teammates that are pushing the boundaries of the way you work and think.</strong></p>
<p>The mindset and approach to things, especially to problems, is also extremely important to us. When applying to any of the positions in the Digital Design team your design skills are not the only ones that will be tested. Your passion, problem-solving skills, ability to learn, receive and give feedback also play a crucial role. It’s in the company values to match the candidates with the culture and mindset of the team they are applying for.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-469" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/culture-full-4.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="590" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/culture-full-4.jpg 1440w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/culture-full-4-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/culture-full-4-768x315.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/culture-full-4-1024x420.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /></p>
<p>Finally, find a team that is as passionate and motivated as you, or even more. Those are the people that will push the boundaries of the way you work and think, and those are the people that will change “I don’t have the time” to “Let’s try it!”. It’s all about the mindset and approach to things. In the worst case scenario, you won’t fail, you’ll just learn something new.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Take a look behind the scenes of “how we squeezed those numbers” in the booking process, improved the website booking experience and made a 39% increase in total booking revenue.</h3>
<p>Camping Village Šimuni is one of the most amazing camps in Croatia. It is the perfect place for a vacation. Our assignment was to completely redesign the website and rethink the Information Architecture as well as the booking experience.</p>
<p>The redesigned <a href="https://www.camping-simuni.hr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Camping Village Šimuni website</a> recorded a 56.5% increase in total bookings and a 39% increase in booking revenue, compared to the same period (February—July) last year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-673 size-full" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/simuni-website-redesign-user-review-01.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="970" height="578" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/simuni-website-redesign-user-review-01.jpg 970w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/simuni-website-redesign-user-review-01-300x179.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/simuni-website-redesign-user-review-01-768x458.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<p>First-time guests were always surprised how great the camp is in the real life. We wanted to provide them with the same experience on the web.</p>
<h4>Preparation Before the Start</h4>
<p>The safest way to success is to start with the project goals in mind and how they align with the customers (users).</p>
<p><strong>Choose a process that enables you to properly define the audience, project and business goals before you dive into specific problems or smaller details.</strong></p>
<p>Our three main user groups were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Families 30–50 years old (60%)</li>
<li>Young couples 25–35 years old (20%)</li>
<li>Friends 25–35 years old (20%)</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal was to increase accommodation booking during the preseason and the main season. Our strategy was to bring the real Camping Šimuni experience to users, to provide them with all the essential info about camp activities, gastro offer, accommodation and to rethink the booking process.</p>
<h4>Analysis, Tools, Insights</h4>
<p>Before we started with the website redesign, we’ve analysed user behaviour, conducted customer interviews as well as usability and A/B/N tests. With the combined data from analytics, Hotjar recordings and results from the various tests, we found our primary focus—the booking form.</p>
<p><strong>Booking form is the last standing barrier between user goal and his intentions to book a vacation on the website. It is the crucial part between success and failure.</strong></p>
<h4>When Everything Else Is Covered, Focus on Booking Form Details</h4>
<p>Our goal from the definition phase was to create a new structure of the website that would be aligned with users’ expectations and needs, but our goal was to also keep the organic traffic intact after the redesign.</p>
<p>During the final phase of defining the Information Architecture and the structure of the website, we used our insights from User flows and attacked the form with the whole arsenal of data, insights and ideas waiting to be tested.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-677 size-full" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/user-journey-user-flow-02.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="970" height="350" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/user-journey-user-flow-02.jpg 970w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/user-journey-user-flow-02-300x108.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/user-journey-user-flow-02-768x277.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<p>Based on user tests, these were the potential areas for mass improvement:</p>
<ol>
<li>The flow and ease of filling the form—users were struggling with inputting data</li>
<li>Wording—some labels, copies and texts were not understandable enough</li>
<li>Users didn’t know (or they forgot when they came to fill the form) the differences between accommodation and their types</li>
<li>Significant drop-off before completing the form</li>
<li>A small amount of user interaction feedback</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Ease of Filling the Form</h4>
<p>The most important thing to do in the form completion flow is to reduce the information burden away from users, while they are providing us with their inputs. There are several strategies used to align input fields, but here I’ll be addressing the benefits of input field organization—by their meaning.</p>
<p>We split the form into two main parts (accommodation info and personal info) in order to provide more focus to the desired part.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1935 size-large" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-09-21-at-13-32-47-1024x785.png?x22406" alt="" width="1024" height="785" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-09-21-at-13-32-47-1024x785.png 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-09-21-at-13-32-47-300x230.png 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-09-21-at-13-32-47-768x589.png 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-09-21-at-13-32-47.png 1930w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The inputs were organized by their topics and meaning, while the size of each field suggested what input type and type of data is expected from user.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-679 size-full" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/input-fields-legth-2.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="970" height="666" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/input-fields-legth-2.jpg 970w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/input-fields-legth-2-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/input-fields-legth-2-768x527.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<h4>Change in Wording Leads to Better Microcopy</h4>
<p>We believe that microcopy is the smallest text with the biggest impact. It is the most important factor as it defines how clear we’ll guide the user and address his concerns.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-680 size-full" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/microcopy-in-form-design.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="970" height="541" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/microcopy-in-form-design.jpg 970w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/microcopy-in-form-design-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/microcopy-in-form-design-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<p>Using clear and informative microcopy, we explained to users about the optional fields, why are they present and why they matter to them. Based on the <a href="https://www.duncanjonesnz.com/case-study-expedias-12-million-a-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">form design research</a>, every optional input field that user needs to fill decreases the potential for conversion.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-681 size-full" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/microcopy-in-form-design-05.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="970" height="541" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/microcopy-in-form-design-05.jpg 970w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/microcopy-in-form-design-05-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/microcopy-in-form-design-05-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<h4>Visual Clues and Instant Access to Information Provide Guidance</h4>
<p>The biggest problem we faced were new users who dropped out of the booking process because they didn’t know the exact differences between three main accommodation categories—the difference between bungalows, mobile homes and camping pitches. In addition to that, they had even more problem distinguishing various accommodation types while inside the booking process.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t underestimate the power of visuals. It is always a good strategy to give more context and simplify the information by showing users how it looks.</strong></p>
<p>We enabled users to have a clear visual representation of accommodation groups and gave them info about room sizes (not just names that give them zero meaning), but also the possibility to visually choose the accommodation type while in the process.</p>
<p><video src="https://player.vimeo.com/external/235925452.sd.mp4?s=617bd2b278684ff693425511455f29f4d5930a2e&amp;profile_id=165" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="780" height="439"></video></p>
<h4>Tackling the Significant Form Completion Drop-Off</h4>
<p>Having in mind how the amount of input fields affects the completion, besides cutting all the unnecessary form fields and going through multiple structure reviews, we put a lot of effort in smart defaults.</p>
<p><strong>Smart defaults are a great way to reduce effort and time users need to invest while filling the form.</strong></p>
<p>When approaching the smart defaults structure, we tried to get it to be as easy as possible for the user, while respecting the business goals. We knew the top 6 countries that guests were coming from and paired them with language selection and location from which they were browsing the site. Based on the smart defaults matrix, we completed the data for the users, together with fallback solutions based on their language or inputs.</p>

<p>Accommodation type, together with the number of guests and additional services (half board), was pre-selected based on user needs.</p>

<h4>Small Interaction Makes a Big Difference</h4>
<p>There’s a need for feedback interaction for every user input. By taking this approach, we are making sure that the user is always safely guided through the process. Users feel safe and in control, rewarding us with their trust in the product.</p>
<p><strong>Small interaction comes as icing on a cake. When all the important parts are in place, this little part is what makes a great experience.</strong></p>
<p>After we defined all of the form validation error and success functionalities, we could focus on those small micro-interactions that provide additional value to users by giving them the feeling of knowing what is “going on around”.</p>

<h4>Break the Mountain Into Smaller Chunks and Then Reduce It to Stones</h4>
<p>A good strategy before defining the problem is to dive into data and research. The discovery output will be much better and you can get surprising insights and a clearer understanding of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>When you form your plan of attack, use the approach of breaking large chunks into smaller parts and focus on the things that make the biggest impact.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>If I were to ask you what Digital Branding is, what would be your first association? People often don’t really know how to answer this question and they tend to wander around visual associations. Yes, brand’s logo is an important part of it, but digital branding is much more than the logo.</h3>
<p>To help you figure out the real value of Digital Branding, I will explain what’s in its core and how it can transform the perception of your digital products in the eyes of your users.</p>
<h4>The Powerful Impact</h4>
<p>What makes us choose the digital tools we are working with every day? What makes our favourite news portal that good? How do we choose which e-commerce service is the best for us? Which running app is our top pick?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1058" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>For every digital product we use, we can ask ourselves why we picked it and not some other. We might say that all of our favourites have great functionalities, that they are secure and trustworthy, that they offer great service and great user experience etc. But how did we get to this conclusions? Before we had the chance to form an opinion, we first had to pick the product.</p>
<p>The selection of digital products these days is huge, and a lot of digital products with the same functionalities are pretty similar in terms of their offerings. So how do we choose the one that is right for us?</p>
<p>Often, when we search for the “right one”, our first step is to google popular digital products and take a leap of faith. If you think about it, to some extent we already trust its quality, we just need to see which one fits our needs better.</p>
<p>So how do we start trusting popular digital products if we never used them before? One of the main reasons is definitely good digital branding.</p>
<h4>It Is Much More Than the Logo</h4>
<p>Digital Branding implies having the vision of what is your brand is. Slogan, colours and shapes of the logo, typography, presentational website, tool, app, microcopy on the buttons, newsletter…everything is a part of the bigger picture defined by your brand’s tone of voice.</p>
<p>Dropbox, Google drive, NY Times, Pitchfork, Nike, Slack… our first associations with these brands would probably be visual because humans are primarily focused on the visual aspects. It’s the reason why we can consciously remember the brand logo, but sometimes we underestimate the importance of other things such as the emotional branding and brand’s tone of voice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1060" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Same as with humans, in order to connect with the brand, we need to bond with it on an emotional level. Colours and shapes are just the final expressions of a carefully thought-out branding strategy. The thing that comes before this is the core of the brand identity – it is the emotional branding.</p>
<p>That’s why you will often hear the question “if your brand was a famous person, who would it be”. It is important to have a clear vision of your identity because that’s the thing you’ll build your brand on. To be able to build this emotional connection, it is important to have a clear vision for the brand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1059" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>There Is Something Special About Your Brand</h4>
<p>The key is to find out what your brand’s best qualities are, and what we mean by that is – what are those two or three things that make your brand really special, what makes it stand out from the competition. Let’s say that you have an IoT company that provides the tool for important data managing. Being able to say that your tool is trustworthy and secure is very important, but that trait’s not something unique to your brand.</p>
<p>To find out what brand traits make your brand stand out from the competition, we need to go a lot deeper with your company or a product. All of the answers are there, we just need to find them in your business model and values. It is the ideology that makes us connect to anything, whether it’s our favourite news portal, a mobile app, a singer or a sports team. The trigger is always the same – we connect to the story of the brand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1057" src="https://deghq.com/wordpress/bornfight/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/4.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/4.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/4-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Through our experiences, we learned of the importance and saw the benefits of having a close partnership with our clients. We had the opportunities to do digital branding strategies that really made difference to our clients, and it’s always the same feeling of excitement when you get these kinds of projects. That is because we know that the process of discovery will give us the best understanding of the brand. When we have that, we believe that we can create a great digital branding strategy that’s aligned with our client’s goals and that will push their digital products to the top.</p>
<h4>Give Your Brand a Voice That Can Be Heard</h4>
<p>How many digital storage tools, other than Google Drive and Dropbox, do you know about? Probably not that many. Their positioning in the market is so good that it is almost impossible to offer a new one. Yes, they have good functionalities, but they also have users’ trust – a thing they built many years. By doing that, they built their entire brand.</p>
<p>By knowing our client’s vision and goals by heart, we can start building a brand identity which will help them to position their digital product on the market. We can help them reach their key audience and, at the same time, save their time and the effort needed to get good results.</p>
<p>Still, it takes time to build a strong brand identity and the consistency is everything. Once you explain your brand to yourself, you will be a lot closer to your goals and the way you want your users to see you. Having a defined tone of voice for your brand will help you to always stay on track and focused on your goals. By defining the tone of voice and completely branding your product, you will add the value to it and that will ultimately enable you to stand out from the crowd.</p>
