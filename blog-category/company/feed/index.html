<h3>Discovery workshops have been a core aspect of our process for years because they proved to have numerous benefits both for our clients and for us. But since our clients have their HQs in different parts of the world, we often need to replace in-person discovery workshops with remote ones. Here’s how we do it!</h3>



<p>A discovery workshop is a part of our initial project definition and planning phase, and its goal is to fully define the scope of the project and goals that need to be achieved, but also to set expectations for all sides involved in the project.</p>



<p><strong>It is extremely beneficial because it:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Can reduce the overall production costs</li><li>Leads to an increased production speed</li><li>Helps minimize the occurrence of risks and issues during production</li><li>Enables clients to meet the team that will be working on their project</li><li>Results in a precise production roadmap for the entire project</li></ol>



<p>Although the overall concept and <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/product-discovery-workshop-top-5-benefits-for-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits</a> are the same, organizing and running a remote discovery workshop is a bit different than conducting a ‘regular’ in-person workshop. There are new tools you have to use, you need to establish some specific rules, prepare a different type of agenda… and on top of that, you still need to ensure everyone is fully involved, engaged and active behind the webcam.</p>



<p>This can sound like quite a bit of extra work, but it’s actually fairly simple if you take into account a few of these pieces of advice we gathered over the years of conducting in-person discovery workshops and remote discovery workshops. So let’s get started!</p>



<h4>#1 Prepare in advance</h4>



<p>Having a “we’ll figure it on-the-fly” mentality is not something we advise when it comes to organizing and conducting discovery workshops. While we’re all for “wingin’ it” from time to time, and sure, some activities can be performed with that approach, remote discovery workshops are not one of them. To make sure everything goes smoothly and according to the plan, preparation is the key.</p>



<p><strong>And this preparation covers everything:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Having a clear structure of the workshop and preparing the agenda in advance, so it can be sent to all of the participants</li><li>Preparing all of the assets that’ll be used or needed — this includes all the templates, tools, documents, prototypes… anything that could be useful during the workshop</li><li>Double checking all of the tools to make sure they’re working as they&#8217;re supposed to — there’s nothing more demotivating than starting the workshop with an hour long troubleshooting session</li><li>Onboarding all of the participants — telling them what they’ll go through, what to prepare for the workshop, how will they communicate, what are the rules and guidelines, showing them all of the tools that’ll be used…</li></ol>



<p><strong>Checking off all of these activities will ensure that the workshop itself goes as smoothly and as efficiently as possible.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5893" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02.jpg 1200w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/qt-benefits_02-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<h4>#2 Get off the tool hype-train</h4>



<p>When it comes to conducting remote discovery workshops, tools are an absolute necessity, but tools can also be an enormous distraction if you go overboard with them. The key here is to only use the tools that enable you to do more activities better and faster, and that ultimately help you go through the workshop in the most efficient way possible. Using tools as a crutch in an effort to minimize the lack of preparation or clear agenda or any other aspect is exactly what you need to avoid.</p>



<p><strong>In our remote discovery workshops, we keep the tools to a minimum:</strong></p>



<ol><li><strong>For conferencing and communication, we use either Google Meet or Zoom<br></strong>Either option is fine as they both have similar features — they work without issues or lag, you can turn on the webcam and turn off the mic, they enable participants to share their screens and they have the option to record the meeting. You don’t need much more than that for a conferencing tool, so the choice between one or the other is just personal preference.</li><li><strong>As a virtual whiteboard, we use Miro<br></strong>Whiteboards are a key element of every discovery workshop, and Miro is just that — a clean and easy to use whiteboard and visual collaboration tool that can be shared with all of the participants. It has all of the necessary features you’ll need, but it also comes with a bunch of pre-configured whiteboard templates which make the initial setup much simpler and faster.</li><li><strong>For prototyping during the workshop, we use Figma<br></strong>Figma is amazing because it enables us to quickly create visual prototypes of the elements we talked about during the workshop. Because of its advanced collaboration functionalities, it enables multiple people to work on the prototype, get feedback, iterate and improve.</li><li><strong>For storing and sharing documents, we use Google Drive</strong><br>When it comes to storing and sharing files, there are numerous options, but Drive is the gold standard. It’s simple, it has all of the features you need and it just plain works.</li></ol>



<p><strong>And that’s it, those are all of the tools we use. And we honestly very rarely feel the need to add another one.</strong></p>



<h4>#3 Limit the number of participants and set clear roles</h4>



<p>When conducting remote discovery workshops, it’s always a good idea to limit the number of participants in order to keep an energetic and productive workflow during the entire workshop. We found that having 4 to 6 people is ideal, and 7 is the upper limit. Within those 4 to 6 people, it’s important that we have at least one decision-maker from our client’s side, while we always involve a set of specialists who will be involved on the project.</p>



<p>Making sure everyone is active and engaged is a bit difficult when you’re just seeing them through the screen, so keeping the number of participants lower will ensure that the optimal level of workflow and the discussion can be maintained at all times.</p>



<p>In addition to limiting the number of participants, we also set specific roles for members within our team — we define who’ll be leading and facilitating the workshop, who’ll be keeping the notes, etc.</p>



<p><strong>By doing that, every person participating in the workshop knows what they’re expected to do, and that ultimately leads to a much more productive environment that is fully focused on the goal.</strong></p>



<h4>#4 Establish a basic set of rules</h4>



<p>Creating a set of rules that should be followed during the course of a remote workshop is necessary in order to keep the focus of everyone involved on the elements that are actually important.</p>



<p><strong>The thing is, participating in a workshop while you’re on a laptop is a distraction waiting to happen, so it’s always a good idea to define a couple of dos and don’ts like:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Turn off the phones to avoid getting distractions</li><li>Postpone answering an email until the first break</li><li>Try not to speak while others are speaking</li><li>Try to keep your webcam on</li><li>Be on time after the break</li></ol>



<p><strong>Simple rules and guidelines like these minimize the distractions and put everyone into the proper working mode for the duration of the workshop.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5527" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>#5 Create a detailed agenda</h4>



<p>Having an agenda beforehand and sharing it with all of the participants is very important, but what’s even more important is structuring it in a way that enables everyone to know exactly what will be discussed during each of the time slots. This is really helpful when it comes to planning for day 2, day 3, day 4… of the workshop.</p>



<p>Here’s what an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yNOz2AFQpkhj0WBzM_ZP-GYW-GJRhm3caKY3uJyi-K4/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example of an agenda</a> for a remote discovery workshop looks like when we’re sending it to our clients. You can see all of the time slots and their main topics, as well as specific elements within those topics that will be covered during the specified time slots.</p>



<p>In addition to creating detailed agendas, with remote workshops we also like to turn the overall daily workload down a notch, so our ‘regular’ 2-day workshops usually turn into remote 3-day workshops with a day off between each workshop day.</p>



<p><strong>Maintaining focus and being fully active and engaged for 8 hours is practically impossible when you’re in front of a screen, so this setup proved to be ideal.</strong></p>



<h4>#6 Use off days to reflect and reorganize</h4>



<p>As we said in the previous section, when we conduct remote discovery workshops, we always have a day off between every workshop day. For example, if we’re conducting a 3-day workshop with a client, Monday, Wednesday and Friday are workshop days, while Tuesday and Thursday are off days.</p>



<p>We organize it that way because we use those off days to reflect on what we’ve done during the previous day and to prepare for the next. Off days are when we analyze all of the decisions, when we work on prototypes and create a specific plan of what we’ll go over the following day. This is also the day when our clients can prepare additional info we might need or go over the aspects we covered during the workshop with their teams.</p>



<p><strong>This setup has proven to be much more effective than having a three day, back to back to back workshop.</strong></p>



<h4>#7 Emphasise engagement</h4>



<p>Making sure that all of the participants are active and engaged during the workshop is essential for its success, and that is even more important when the workshop is conducted via a video conferencing tool. The thing is, participating in a workshop while you’re alone in front of a computer screen just isn’t as stimulating as being in a room full of other people — pair that with a conversation that is sometimes laggy, devoid of side conversations, gestures, body language… and that high-energy workshop experience gets really toned down and that can lead to decreases engagement.</p>



<p>That is why we have strategically organized tasks and breaks during our workshop days, and why facilitators who lead our remote discovery workshops with clients are always keeping a close eye on the overall dynamics, speed and energy of the discussion.</p>



<p><strong>When those levels start decreasing, that means it’s time to pull people back into the conversation with a new question or a topic.</strong></p>

<h3>Remote work is becoming quite popular, and it doesn&#8217;t show any signs of slowing down. More and more employees are starting to work remotely, either just for a few days a week or full time. </h3>



<p>In this blog post, I will cover some of the advantages and disadvantages I experienced in these last few weeks during which we shifted from full-time in-office work to full-time remote work due to the outbreak of the coronavirus.</p>



<p>So, let’s dive into them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5701" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Pros of working remote</h4>



<h5>Not wasting time and energy on the commute </h5>



<p>I would highlight this one as a really powerful advantage because everyday commuting can sometimes be quite challenging and exhausting, especially if you live far away from your office as I do. Traffic jams, overcrowded public transport, and nervous people can affect your mood in a bad way and cost you a lot of time and energy. </p>



<p>Imagine spending that time and energy doing something else or just doing nothing at all &#8211; whatever tickles your fancy. When you&#8217;re working remote, that&#8217;s exactly what you can do!</p>



<h5>Working hour flexibility</h5>



<p>Flexibility could arguably be a double-edged sword and, if not treated responsibly, it may have a negative impact on your productivity and focus. Nonetheless, the good thing is that you can organize your schedule according to your personal obligations and needs, and coordinate it with your circadian rhythm &#8211; maybe you&#8217;re an early bird, maybe you&#8217;re a night owl. </p>



<p><strong>Even more importantly, making your own hours means that you can figure out when you are most productive and fresh, and work during those times &#8211; just keep in mind to also respect your coworkers’ schedules. </strong></p>



<p>In my case, I usually work in two phases, the first one is in the morning after I wake up and do my morning routine (stretching, breakfast, tea/coffee, etc). Then I take a longer, 2-hour break around 2 PM during which I prepare lunch, do a power nap if needed, relax a little and enjoy so I am fresh to do all of the remaining work afterwards. </p>



<p>This schedule is not always the same and varies from day to day, because as a student I don’t usually work for 8 hours every day, so it heavily depends on my college obligations and meets/calls I have to do at certain times. But, what I have noticed is that my productivity is much better when I do something in two phases with a long break in between.</p>



<h5>Creating your own working ambiance </h5>



<p>Working in the office doesn’t always come with a complete freedom to arrange your working environment however you like. For example, when you&#8217;re working from home, you could find the most comfortable place, wear clothes that you feel the most comfortable in, play some background music, adjust lights and temperature to fully fit your needs etc. </p>



<p><strong>All these small things can improve your mood, comfort and, in the end, productivity.  A little pro tip &#8211; easy background jazz or ambient music, subtle desk light and the smell of incense sticks or candles work super fine (at least for me).</strong></p>



<h5>Power nap </h5>



<p>We all know that unpleasant feeling of fatigue just after the lunch and imagining how perfect it would be to just lay down in stillness and close our eyes for a moment. When you&#8217;re working in the office, you usually don&#8217;t have a dedicated space for power napping &#8211; but you have one at home. So if you&#8217;re working from home, I find that taking 20 to 30 minutes of power napping (don&#8217;t go any longer as you might start feeling sluggish) really refreshes you and gets you back on track. </p>



<h5>Being your own chef </h5>



<p>Compared to food delivery, cooking at home not only saves you money, but it also gives you a chance to experiment, improve your cooking skills and make your meals more diverse and healthier. We&#8217;re three weeks into this remote work and I can honestly say that I&#8217;m starting to get really good.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5702" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body02-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Cons of working remote</h4>



<h5>Communication, collaboration and social contact </h5>



<p>Although there are many online tools for communication and collaboration nowadays, I think nothing can really compare to face-to-face communication. For me, it is much easier to communicate something, especially some harder topics, when I&#8217;m right next to someone. Also, if you are working in a team, I feel it is much more convenient to be at the same place because of the “team energy” and that in-person aspect. And you can also resolve issues and help each other much quicker. </p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;re full-time remote, we had to come up with a few things to keep that team energy high. At our office, we have a giant terrace where we all used to go on breaks &#8211; since we&#8217;re no longer at the office, we created a Hangouts meet called “virtual terrace” that&#8217;s open all day. You just need to turn on your webcam, join and you&#8217;ll always find someone there &#8211; it&#8217;s a great solution to help you hang out with others if you need more of that social contact while you&#8217;re working from home.</p>



<h5>Office energy and finding motivation </h5>



<p>The office has that powerful ability to put you in a working mood almost instantly and give you an extra boost of motivation. Working atmosphere created by you and your other colleagues, as a result, has a positive impact on your focus, productivity and team spirit &#8211; as opposed to working from home, where I found out that it&#8217;s much easier to fall into the trap of procrastinating. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to create a home atmosphere that will keep you focused and motivated &#8211; like the one I described up in the pros section!</p>



<h5>New kind of distractions</h5>



<p>While an office has its own set of unique distractions, it is a fact that you&#8217;re very likely to experience distractions while working remotely. This can include distractions like your family (especially if they&#8217;re bored and don’t work), household noises, pets, video games, etc. </p>



<p>Luckily, some of them can be reduced to a minimum just by communicating your working schedule to others living with you, and kindly asking for some piece and quiet. Just as I did with my parents by asking them to not produce loud noises during my working hours and to basically pretend that I&#8217;m at the office &#8211; that means no disturbing with unimportant things they wouldn&#8217;t disturb me with if I wasn&#8217;t at. home in the first place.</p>



<h4>And now the conclusion</h4>



<p>All the above-mentioned advantages and disadvantages depend on perspective, personality, and circumstances, which may differ from person to person. It’s only important that you are aware of them &#8211; to be able to find what suits you the most and create an environment in which you feel most productive and comfortable, whether that&#8217;s the office, your home or maybe something completely different. </p>

<h3>Crisis doesn’t care. It doesn’t care about the work you do, your processes, your projects or your company’s financial stability. It has its own path and impacts anything that stands in its way. So when it comes to successful crisis management, it’s up to you to adjust and find a way to counter it!</h3>



<p>In our previous blog about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="building a crisis-proof business (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/resist-adapt-innovate-building-a-crisis-proof-business/" target="_blank">building a crisis-proof business</a>, we mentioned the importance of changing your mindset when it comes to leading a company and the way you approach things when a crisis strikes. We talked about how crucial it is to implement changes that are long-lasting &#8211; ones that will benefit your company indefinitely, and not just for the duration of the crisis. In this blog, we’ll go a little deeper into what adjusting to a crisis really means when it comes to changing your business processes and projects.</p>

<h4>That’s how we always used to do things around here</h4>



<p>Throw that mindset into the trash. I’m serious &#8211; when it’s all good and without a crisis in sight, that type of mindset is usually frowned upon (especially in rapidly changing industries like the IT), because it’s all about keeping the status quo and doing just enough to keep your company stable. When a crisis strikes, every industry turns into a rapidly changing industry, because that’s the way you minimize the impact. And if your standard way of operating is ‘but that’s how we always used to do things around here’, you probably won’t have that battle-hardened experience needed to make quick decisions, implement changes and stay ahead of the crisis. And that type of experience is always great to have, regardless of the situation!</p>



<p>So my advice to you is &#8211; throw the ‘that’s how we always used to do things around here’ mindset into the trash and use this current crisis to make your company more crisis-proof. Yeah, it might feel a little rusty at first, but long-term benefits of operating in a way that prioritizes change are tenfold.</p>



<p>Let me give you an example of this that just happened. Croatian bureaucracy, probably like the majority of bureaucracies around the world, is all about strict procedures, paperwork, having everything neatly signed and stamped and delivered to the right office and then going to the next office to get another form you need to fill out and then return to the previous office just to find out you forgot to bring a crucial document and… you get the point. And if you thought about emailing those documents, well that was a no. Before this current crisis, that was the standard way of operating… fast-forward into the crisis and now it’s email all the things &#8211; and it works much smoother, faster, it’s more streamlined and the overall user experience is miles ahead of what it used to be.</p>



<p><strong>Yeah, my point here is &#8211; if Croatian bureaucracy can change the way it operates in a time of crisis and let go of its old ways, I believe your company can too! </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5690" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body02-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Think fast</h4>



<p>Or better yet, think about your company being fast, even faster and constantly adjusting your internal processes and ways of doing things to be two steps ahead of the crisis. Here’s the deal, times of crises are times of uncertainty, so you no longer have years to test and implement a new tool, build a new in-house team or switch your sales processes from being primarily offline to being online-first (like a lot of brick and mortar stores are now doing by launching webshops to keep their businesses active). At best, you have a few months to adjust, so make sure to utilize that time efficiently &#8211; use tools to gather data about your business and really dig into it, analyze the data you have, locate your strengths and painpoints and start working on those that might yield you the most benefits in the shortest amount of time (if you want to know more about gathering and analyzing data, and how your company can benefit from it, <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="get in touch (opens in a new tab)">get in touch</a>).</p>



<p>That is something we did at Bornfight when this entire situation started and we rapidly needed to adjust to new ways our clients started doing business. As their situations changed, they needed more rapid improvements to <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/services/custom-software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="software (opens in a new tab)">software</a> and solutions we created for them &#8211; so we analyzed our processes and saw that in order to meet their new needs, we had to speed up our own process of onboarding new people onto projects  We used to have a much more complex onboarding system, but this change prompted us to reanalyze everything, take out the steps that have proven to be inefficient or unneeded and create a new way of operating. And now our process of onboarding people onto projects is much faster and more streamlined than before &#8211; I’d even say it’s as close to plug-and-play as we can be at this moment.  </p>



<p><strong>To conclude this section, I’ll say this &#8211; time is the only commodity you can’t get back or create more of it, and it’s even more valuable in a time of crisis when everything is on a deadline, so be fast and maximize the time that’s available to you. </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5691" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Think flexible </h4>



<p>Another aspect of adjusting your business processes or projects to an ongoing crisis is to focus on being as flexible as possible. Let me paint you a picture &#8211; when push comes to shove, flexible businesses survive by adapting, going around a crisis and dodging its impacts, while businesses that aren’t flexible survive only if they’re strong enough to sustain the full impact of a crisis. This aspect of business flexibility is closely connected to the section about distancing yourself and your company from the ‘that’s how we always used to do things here’ mindset, so you can think of it as an extension. Here’s what I mean by it &#8211; you can’t be flexible if you want to do your thing the old way, but you can throw away that ‘old way’ mindset without being flexible. Ideally, you want to do both, and when it comes to a crisis, you’ll kind of need to.</p>



<p>Again, we’ll go back to gathering and analyzing the available data about your business, as data is your key decision-making guide in a time of crisis. Write down all of your processes with a short description of how your business is currently doing it, and then see what can be upgraded in a way that counters the crisis. </p>



<p><strong>Here’s an example:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Sales process &#8211; does it have to be offline or can you do it through a webshop?</li><li>Worker training &#8211; can 1-on1 training be substituted for online workshops?</li><li>Order management &#8211; are you still doing it by hand or can you automate with software?</li><li>Productivity tracking &#8211; do you need punch cards or is a time tracking tool better?</li></ul>



<p>There’s always a way to upgrade a process &#8211; the key is just to analyze your business. Analyze why, how and what you’re currently doing, and then create a plan of how it should be done in order to better fit your company now, the current (crisis) situation and the way you want your company to grow in the future. </p>



<p>Let me give you another example based on a process we just changed at Bornfight &#8211; discovery workshops. <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/resources/why-businesses-need-product-discovery-workshops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Product discovery workshops (opens in a new tab)">Product discovery workshops</a> are a key element of every project we work on &#8211; before we start with any kind of design or development, we fly our clients to our office or visit theirs, and then conduct a very extensive 4 day workshop during which we dig deep into our client’s business, uncover their strengths and painpoints, and create a detailed production plan for a solution they hired us to build. From the day we implemented discovery workshops into our process, we always conducted them face-to-face. Now that borders are being closed and a lot of people are in self-isolation, having workshops face to face is no longer an option &#8211; but does that mean we can no longer take on any new projects? Of course it doesn’t. What we needed to do was take the core principles of discovery workshops, adjust them a bit until we could transfer them online and now we have virtual discovery workshops (a blog with tips on how to implement them is coming soon, so stay tuned) &#8211; technology was already there and all we needed was a bit of flexibility when it came to changing our mindset and approach. </p>



<p><strong>Was that change a piece of cake? No. But are its benefits worth it? Absolutely. </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5692" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body03.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_adjust_body03-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Think different</h4>



<p>Not in terms of Apple, but in terms of how you can use various tools, platforms, processes, projects or any other resource or asset in a way it’s not yet been used &#8211; this is where your creativity and lateral thinking needs to kick in.</p>



<p>Here’s a great example. You’ve heard about TikTok? It’s an extremely popular mobile application with more than 500 million active users that enables them to record and post videos of themselves that are only a few seconds long. TikTok was never intended to be a platform for streaming long-form content or movies. Well, that was the case until this crisis started and Huanxi Media Group, a Chinese media company, saw they’ll lose quite a bit of money because movie theaters are closed and they can’t launch their new movie. They got in contact with the owners of TikTok, presented the idea to stream the movie on the platform, and now you can watch a 2 hour movie on TikTok &#8211; a platform primarily intended for 60-second videos.</p>



<p>Another awesome example of thinking differently in a time of crisis comes from a Chinese e-commerce giant, JD Logistics. To counter the impact of the crisis on their business and to help deliver medical care, JD Logistics utilized their fleet of self-driving vehicles to deliver supplies across a heavily quarantined Wuhan. And in addition to utilizing delivery vehicles, JD Logistics also provided access to its Level-4 autonomous driving solutions, thus enabling even more autonomous delivery robot manufacturers to update their technologies in the wake of this crisis, which is bound to result in an even faster advancement of self-driving technologies and solutions.</p>



<p><strong>The point here is clear &#8211; take a look at your assets and resources, or those of your clients and partners. There’s bound to be at least one that can be used in a different, creative way!</strong></p>

<h3>A lot of non-remote companies are now switching to remote work, so I thought I&#8217;d share a couple of tips that help me stay organized, focused and more efficient when I&#8217;m working from home.</h3>



<p>This blog won&#8217;t focus on software, tools and apps that are usually used when working from home, but more on the mindset and the activities you can do to get in the zone. OK, let&#8217;s start with the tips!</p>



<h4>TIP #1 Create a routine</h4>



<p>When working from home, a lot of people believe they don&#8217;t need a routine, a plan and a timeline of what they should be working on, and that is a surefire way to get into a trap of thinking that when you&#8217;re working from home you aren&#8217;t actually working. And that&#8217;s not actually true &#8211; when you&#8217;re home you&#8217;re working, and the only thing you&#8217;re not is travelling to the office.</p>



<p><strong>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Try and wake up at the same time (that puts you into the right mindset and gets you ready for the day)</li><li>Get dressed &#8211; no need to get fancy or anything, but taking off your pajamas and slipping into something more professional will help you get into that &#8216;work&#8217; mode</li><li>Do all your regular morning rituals &#8211; make coffee, take a look at the industry news or anything else that you usually do before work</li></ul>



<p>Having a routine like this will enable you to connect some of those habits with work, and will prevent you from mixing your free time with your work time &#8211; and that ultimately leads to a better focus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5534" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body01-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>TIP #2 Define your daily goals</h4>



<p>When you turn on your laptop and start working, it&#8217;s really important to have a detailed plan for the day (ideally &#8211; an entire week). It&#8217;s important because having a plan means you can create an estimate of what it will take you to finish each of the tasks (and it also help you practice giving those task estimates).</p>



<p>If you have a plan that fills up your entire work day, you&#8217;ll be able to constantly track your progress and react if you see that some of the things aren&#8217;t going according to the plan (and then you can inform project managers or other team members on time).</p>



<p>Defining your daily goals and the overall plan will help you to see the bigger picture of the project and your role in it, which will ultimately lead to a much clearer focus when it comes to delivery and achieving results.</p>



<p></p>



<h4>TIP #3 Know when to log off</h4>



<p>Just because you&#8217;re working from home doesn&#8217;t mean that your work day is automatically longer. Be mindful of the fact that your overall productivity and efficiency might go down rapidly if you&#8217;re working late in the afternoons or the evenings, so it&#8217;s usually a better option to leave a task for the next morning when you&#8217;ll be well rested and sharp. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re constantly working late to finish your tasks (e.g. because they need to be delivered that day), than it&#8217;s a big possibility that you&#8217;re making a mistake when you&#8217;re creating your daily plans in the morning &#8211; you might think that you&#8217;d be able to do a task faster that you really could or maybe you don&#8217;t set your work priorities the right way. Try to optimize your daily plans to see what works best for you and how much work can you actually do during a regular work day!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5528" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_simic_remote_tips_body02-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>TIP #4 Communicate regularly</h4>



<p>Streamlined communication with your team enables you to work more smoothly, and that is especially true when you&#8217;re working remote. Slack, Hangouts, Loom, Lightshot, Miro&#8230; those are just some of the tools that are ideal for sharing information with your team &#8211; so use them!</p>



<p><strong>Here are some examples of when it&#8217;s important to share the information with your team:</strong></p>



<ul><li>You defined your daily plan, so you send out the info in order for your colleagues (senior members of the team, project managers&#8230;) to know what you&#8217;ll be working on and what they can expect from you</li><li>Your daily plan gets changed for some reason (maybe you got another task that has a higher priority or maybe a task takes longer than expected), so you inform others to enable them to react on time and adjust (e.g. switch up the plans, or communicate the delay to other teams)</li><li>You have some questions &#8211; this is common sense, but when you&#8217;re working alone from home, you can sometimes really forget to ask others to help you out or explain something to you if you get stuck</li></ul>



<h4>TIP #5 Hang out with your team</h4>



<p>Calls, chats and all other types of communication aren&#8217;t just for work. Remember, when you&#8217;re working remote, it&#8217;s really important to keep that team spirit high and communicate with each other about the things that aren&#8217;t just work-related (just like you do when you&#8217;re at the office). </p>



<p>Keeping your communication channels open, having lunch over a video call or going on a break together will really help you stay connected with the people you&#8217;re working with!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>In two days, we went from being a company that only thought about one day being able to organize wide-scale remote work to having all of our employees working from home without any issues.</h3>



<p>Bornfight was never a remote-first company. Yeah, we work remotely with our international clients, so we already adopted a lot of remote work methodologies and processes that enabled us to streamline this transition. But we never conducted any larger experiments that would give us some deeper insight on what would it be like to have all of our employees work from home and how it would affect the way we operate as a company. You know, we really cherish that aspect of togetherness we have by working alongside each other in the office, so ‘remote work’ at Bornfight was just about giving every member of the team the option to spend a few days a month working from home if they wanted to &#8211; it was never anything larger or more complex than that. Well, until now!</p>



<blockquote class="c-quotes__item">
    <p class="u-a4">We took this current situation very seriously, so every single member of our team is safe at home. There’s no point risking it when we can work just as efficiently and deliver everything as planned.</p>
    <div class="c-quotes__info">
        <p class="u-b5">Tomislav Grubišić</p>
        <p class="u-b6">Bornfight CEO</p>
    </div>
</blockquote>



<p>Even though our government is currently only advising people to work from home (it’s not yet a direct order) if they can, we decided to use this latest crisis as a push to go all in on remote work, so this blog will be more like a small case study in which we’ll explain all of the decisions we made and activities we conducted in order to go from non-remote to full-remote in 2 days. And if some of them can help your company implement remote work during this period, all the better.</p>



<p>OK, let’s get to it!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5497" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body03.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body03-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Have a dedicated transition team</h4>



<p>Making sure that a company with 70+ people goes full-remote in a couple of days is a challenging task, but it would be so much more challenging, maybe even impossible, if it weren’t for our Work From Home support team. </p>



<p>Spearheaded by our CEO, Operations Manager and HR team, WFH makes sure that we all have the necessary tools, information and guidelines that would allow us to fully focus on our part of the job &#8211; delivering top-notch software, mobile apps and websites.</p>



<p>In addition to writing down the documentation explaining how our processes will change now that we’re working from home and how we should approach work, providing us with some of the most important pieces of information about working remote, keeping us constantly in the loop regarding the current situation and ensuring that we have all the equipment we need (and I really mean all the equipment &#8211; the chair I’m sitting on at the office, I’m sitting on it right now as it was just delivered to me yesterday), they are also our full-time support ready to help us or solve any challenge we might have with working from home.</p>



<p>Having a team like that by your side doesn’t just enable you to focus on your work, it’s also a prerequisite for quick and easy implementation of the other elements we’ll talk about in this blog.</p>

    <p class="u-a4">One of the key elements that enabled us to switch so quickly is our Work From Home team that consists of our Operations Manager and HR department. Having a team that’s fully dedicated was instrumental to making this work smoothly.</p>

<h4>Communicate, communicate, comunicate</h4>



<p>To give you a great representation of what a good internal communication strategy looks like, take a look at this timeline of our internal activities.</p>



<ul><li>March 12th &#8211; we held the first ‘all hands on deck’ meeting about this crisis and decided that the 16th of March will be the day when we’ll all be working remotely.</li><li>After the meeting, we all got an email with a detailed follow up &#8211; everything we mentioned during the meet was in that document.</li><li>March 13th &#8211; we got the first email update with our CEO’s thoughts about the current situation and a concept of Bornfight going full remote.</li><li>March 13th &#8211; we got an email from our Operations Manager with all of the documents and guidelines regarding remote work.</li><li>March 15th &#8211; another email from our Operations Manager with some quick updates regarding remote work that starts on the following day.</li><li>March 16th &#8211; another email from our CEO that gives a detailed overview of the current state of Bornfight, as well as the next steps that the company will take.</li><li>After that email, we get a new one from our Head of Finance informing us on a few new policies that Croatian government will be discussing in the following days (to minimize the crisis’ effect on Croatian economy).</li><li>By the end of the day, we got another email from our CEO that gave us the brief overview of the meetings he had with our clients and their take on this crisis, as well a couple of viable scenarios for the company going forward.</li><li>March 17th &#8211; morning update from our CEO who now gave us a step by step plan that the company will be doing over the next period to minimize the impact of this crisis.</li><li> Another email from our Head of Finance that gave us a detailed overview of all the policies the Government passed. </li></ul>



<p>This blog is published on Wednesday, the 18th of March, and as you can see from this timeline, all members of Bornfight are being constantly updated on the latest developments regarding the state of the company, the effect of this crisis and the future steps we’ll be taking.</p>



<p>Communicating like this with your employees and being fully transparent is extremely important as it minimizes the element of uncertainty and lowers any potential stress that might come as a result of an ongoing crisis. This has a positive effect as it shows your employees that you have the situation under control and that they can focus on their work &#8211; as I said in a previous blog, this action not only alleviates the negative effect a crisis may have on the effect of your employees, but it also has a positive effect on your financial stability.</p>

<h4>Make sure your employees are fully equipped</h4>



<p>In order for all our team members to be able to work from home, they need to have all of the tools and technology at their disposal &#8211; access to laptops and smartphones are just a part of the equation.</p>



<p>At Bornfight, our WFH team organized so that we can take anything we might need:</p>



<ul><li>Laptops &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Smartphones &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Tablets &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Dongles (we work on MacBooks, so #DongleLife is our daily routine) &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Extra monitor &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Second extra monitor &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Testing smartphones &#8211; CHECK</li><li>WiFi routers (for just in case) &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Any other peripheral &#8211; CHECK</li><li>Office chairs (you read that right) &#8211; CHECK</li></ul>



<p>And if some of us couldn’t take some of that home during our last day at the office, they organized delivery for everybody (now you know how I’m sitting on my office chair at home). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5495" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Ensure continuous delivery</h4>



<p>We may no longer work from the office, but our mindset and approach to projects is still the same. As we already work with a lot of international clients, we adopted a lot of remote work methodologies that enable us to keep delivering at a rapid pace, while simultaneously keeping our clients constantly in the loop.</p>



<p>Here’s what that approach consists of:</p>



<ul><li>Everything revolves around agile and Scrum &#8211; this enables us to be fully organized and create at a very fast pace, while also being extremely flexible when it comes to adapting to our clients’ needs</li><li>All documents are in the cloud &#8211; nothing is stored locally because cloud enables us to quickly access anything from anywhere and onboard new people onto the project in a matter of moments</li><li>Project onboarding is rapid &#8211; the time needed to upgrade a team with new people is minimal in order to accommodate changes in our clients&#8217; needs</li><li>Communication and organization are centralized &#8211; we use project management tools like Jira and communication tools like Slack while we work on projects, so that everything is easily accessible both for us and clients </li><li>Transparency on all levels &#8211; clients we work with know exactly how we’re progressing at any moment</li></ul>



<blockquote class="c-quotes__item">
    <p class="u-a4">We work remote with a majority of our clients, so we know how crucial good communication is. With this new situation, we’re just kicking it up a level since all of us are also remote.</p>

<h4>Take your HR processes from offline to online</h4>



<p>Switching from office work to remote work means some of the processes will need to be adjusted in order to maintain the same level of efficiency and workflow the team was accustomed to while at the office.</p>



<p>This is especially true when it comes to HR processes like onboardings, recruiting, conducting interviews, psychological testing. As we can no longer do them from the office, we tailored them to fit the online format a little bit better.</p>



<p>When it comes to recruitment, we shifted the entire process online &#8211; we are now conducting virtual testing, interviews are conducted through video calls… and everything is going according to the plan. There was a bit of an adjustment period with the first interview, but now it’s almost the same as our regular in-office selection process.</p>



<p>As for the onboarding, switching it was even quicker as all of our documents are already online, we just implemented the video chat component as opposed to regular in-person educations, and it works like a charm.</p>



<p>Another aspect that needed to be switched was the leadership and mentorship &#8211; to make sure all of our team members have full support from their mentors, team leads and heads of departments, we advised them to increase the level of communication between team members. When you’re at the office, you can easily see when a member of your team needs assistance, but you can’t do that from home &#8211; that’s why we now placed an even bigger emphasis on communication.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body04.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5498" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body04.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body04-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Create financial strategies and scenarios</h4>



<p>Ensuring that your company has a steady cash flow is important at any moment, and especially so when a crisis is around. During a crisis, every company gets hit because the entire market is connected &#8211; that&#8217;s just inevitable. But how hard will a company get hit, that&#8217;s something we can work on. </p>



<p>To make sure Bornfight experiences as little of that negative effect as possible and that we all stay together as a team, we created a set of scenarios that represent how the crisis might affect us in the following months with different tiers of severity. And we use those scenarios, combined with the overview of the global market to adjust our business strategies, KPI&#8217;s and the overall cash flow.</p>



<p>Our top priority is to protect the current team, as that team will ensure we can successfully navigate out of this crisis &#8211; that is why people and their salaries are the most protected aspect of any cost-cutting plan we might have to implement during this crisis. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body06.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5500" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body06.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body06-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body06-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body06-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Don’t forget about your office</h4>



<p>On the 12th of March, we decided that Monday the 16th will be the day when we’ll be closing our office and going full remote for 2 weeks (possibly more &#8211; depending on the situation with COVID-19 and the general situation in Croatia). But just because we’re not there doesn’t mean that we completely forgot about it.</p>



<p>The first thing we did &#8211; we cleared out all of the necessary equipment and then completely disinfected the entire office. Better safe, than sorry!</p>



<p>After that, we contacted all of our clients and informed them that all of our planned in-person meetings, educations and product discovery workshops will be held online. Also, since we’re constantly either hosting or providing space for meetups, we postponed all of our events and informed our partners that they won’t be able to use the space for their meetups during this period.</p>



<p>We also have our Work From Home team and Office department on standby if anything out of the ordinary occurs, or if some of our team members will need anything extra from the office!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5496" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_dorian_crisis_management_body02-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Maintain the team spirit</h4>



<p>This last part is all about staying connected while we’re physically apart. As a company that really thrives on togetherness and has a strong company culture, we’re doing the most to continue with our team activities, whether it’s taking a break together, having lunch, hanging out after work… the only difference is that now it’s all digital.</p>



<p>From day 1 of our remote work journey, we started simulating our in-office kitchen and having lunch together &#8211; we’d just join a video call with others, eat, chat, have fun. True, watching a bunch of people eating on your laptop screen took a bit of getting used to, but it was fun and felt like our regular lunch.</p>



<p>To push it a bit further, we’re also in the process of creating our virtual lounge where anyone could join in and just hang out with anyone else who’s currently connected. Keep in mind that maintaining the team spirit is important during times like these, so do what you can to really boost it!</p>

<h3>In this edition of Digging Deeper, we sat down with our iOS development team lead, Filip, and got him to tell us more about the work of iOS developers at Bornfight.</h3>



<p>_____<br>Want to join our mobile development team? Check out our open positions:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.bornfight.com/careers/ios-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="iOS Developer (M/F) (opens in a new tab)">iOS Developer (M/F)</a></li></ul>



<p>_____</p>



<h4>Let’s start with a general one. Tell us a bit more about Bornfight’s iOS team… </h4>



<p>OK, here’s the gist of it. The iOS team is a part of a larger mobile unit within Bornfight, and that unit consists of a specialized Android team and an iOS team. As far as iOS goes, I’d say we’re a very focused and tech-oriented team whose work primarily revolves around creating mobile applications that could be described as quite challenging and complex.</p>



<p>We work on a large variety of apps &#8211; from customer-focused lifestyle and social applications that are readily available for everyone on the App Store, all the way to highly specialized internal and B2B applications for businesses. </p>



<p>As for technologies, we really like to experiment, so we worked on AR and VR applications, as well as a variety of apps that utilized the IoT technology… so yeah, I’d say there’s always something new in the team. Whether it’s a new type of a mobile app we got to develop, or some new piece of tech that was just released and we want to experiment with it &#8211; there’s always an opportunity to grow, learn something new, upgrade our processes or architectures… and the best part is that everyone can be a part of it.  </p>



<h4>You mentioned a large variety of apps, let’s dig a little deeper into them… </h4>



<p>Yeah, as I said, there’s a lot we do, and a lot to talk about. At Bornfight, our goal is to always create long-lasting partnerships with our clients, so a lot of the mobile applications we work on are long-term projects that are constantly being upgraded and made better. There are a number of apps in our portfolio of work that started as MVPs (minimum viable products) some 3-4 years ago, and have grown and are still growing thanks to those successful long-lasting partnerships partnerships and continuous upgrades. For example, <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/work/pvtistes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Pvtistes (opens in a new tab)">Pvtistes</a>, <a href="https://ajmo.hr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Ajmo! (opens in a new tab)">Ajmo!</a> and <a href="https://mojazuja.ozujsko.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Moja Žuja (opens in a new tab)">Moja Žuja</a> are among those apps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_milisa_watchos_desktop-1024x575.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4192" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_milisa_watchos_desktop-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_milisa_watchos_desktop-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_milisa_watchos_desktop-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>So, MVP is the main approach you follow? </h4>



<p>Exactly. Our goal is to always start with a <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/digital-product-development-5-tips-for-building-a-successful-mvp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Minimum Viable Product (opens in a new tab)">Minimum Viable Product</a>. We do it as it has been proven to be the quickest way to get the first functional version of the application into our clients’ hands, and because it’s a prerequisite for creating a successful long-term app development strategy.</p>



<p>MVP has been our approach of choice for quite some time, because when you start working on the application, it’s impossible to predict how users will react to it, how they’ll react to certain features or design elements… and that makes any kind of long-term business and development planning extremely difficult. The MVP approach turns that around because it revolves around creating the first functional version of the app with just enough features to satisfy early users, and then testing on users, receiving feedback and iterating based on that feedback. It’s more agile and flexible and, in the end, gives the application a higher chance of succeeding and achieving goals.</p>



<h4>Excellent, excellent. Now, tell me more about those different types of apps you mentioned at the beginning… </h4>



<p>In general, there are 2 main types of mobile application that we’re focused on. </p>



<p>The first type are B2B applications whose goal is most often to enhance the business processes of a certain company. When it comes to this type of mobile apps, we dig deep into the business of our client, analyze all of their processes, pinpoint pain points and see how they work, and then we define certain aspects of their business that could be made faster, more efficient or just overall better if they were done with a mobile application. This is quite an interesting type of apps to work on because every industry has its own type of specific processes and issues it’s facing.</p>



<p>The second type are B2C apps that are available for everyone to download right there on the App Store. And this is where the variety I talked about really comes into play, because we develop social networks, different lifestyle applications… this is also the type of apps where we’re most likely to use AR, VR, IoT and other types of technologies that are trending in mobile development.</p>



<h4>You keep mentioning technologies, so I think it’s about time we talk some more about it… </h4>



<p>The main point is that we always try to be on the bleeding edge of technology and to incorporate it into our workflow as much as possible. We’re constantly looking to upgrade the way we work, to make our processes more streamlined, to make development itself simpler and quicker… and new understanding new tech can greatly help us with it. I believe we’ll never reach a point where we’ll just stop and say that we know enough and that we don’t need to implement anything new.</p>



<p>Now, as far as specific technologies go, we use Swift as a main programming language. When I think about it, we actually started using it from the first version that was launched. We’ve also been using RxSwift as our core framework for quite some time, and with Apple releasing Combine, which is basically their version of RxSwift, we’re ready to quickly add it to our stack as it’s very, very similar. </p>



<p>Our main database is Realm &#8211; it’s extremely simple to setup, and it proved to be more than capable of handling any project we ever worked on. When it comes to architecture, we actually created our own, it’s called Coconut, and it can be described as a mix between MVVM and VIPER. <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/coconut-architecture-the-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="I wrote a few blogs about it (opens in a new tab)">I wrote a few blogs about it</a>, so feel free to check them out and learn about it.</p>



<p>And the last aspect I should mention is deployment automation &#8211; for this, we use GitlabCI and Fastlane. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_anic_javakotlin_desktop-1024x575.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-3977" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_anic_javakotlin_desktop-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_anic_javakotlin_desktop-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_anic_javakotlin_desktop-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>Let’s switch it up a bit. Tell me more about the iOS developer position… </h4>



<p>Well, the most important aspect, or characteristic of iOS developers at Bornfight is that they’re able to see and understand the bigger picture behind every project they’re working on &#8211; they can independently work on a project, they know what they need to achieve and what’s the best way to achieve it, they’re also comfortable in communicating and cooperating with other teams that are working on the same project (eg. design, project management, back-end development). All in all, they’re experienced in handling mobile app projects from the first line of code to the app’s publishing on the App Store and beyond.</p>



<p>Another important aspect is proactivity &#8211; we expect our iOS developers to help us grow as a team, both in terms of improving the infrastructure we’re working in, as well as mentoring junior members of the team.</p>



<p>Those would be some of the main responsibilities of our iOS developers. </p>



<h4>Give us a couple of examples, something more specific…  </h4>



<p>OK, got it. I believe that good iOS developers are the ones who have successfully delivered a number of applications and can give accurate estimates regarding the scope of a project, and who can also understand the process of publishing applications and the entire iOS ecosystem. Basically, developers who can independently create an iOS application.</p>



<p>Also, it’s important that iOS developers can detect when certain aspects of a project are a bit off or if there are more efficient ways to perform certain actions. For example, they can decide when using a custom element is better than using a native element, or vice versa. Or when it comes to working with back-end teams, great iOS devs will be able to clearly communicate what they want to get from an API etc. That’s the technical side.</p>



<p>The other, teamworking side, is all about proactivity and helping the team to grow. It mostly revolves around upgrading processes and sharing knowledge between members of the team through educations and workshops or by guiding junior members through tasks and projects. </p>



<h4>You talk about working independently on projects, but you also constantly mention teamwork. Can you explain one and the other?  </h4>



<p>OK, yeah, it’s like this &#8211; as an iOS developer at Bornfight, you won’t be working alone on a project. You’ll work with other developers, project managers, designers, strategic partnerships managers… and that’s where this teamworking aspect and that team player attitude comes into play. You need to be able to clearly communicate your needs, delegate tasks to junior members of the team, report on progress…</p>



<p>As for working independently, that’s all about understanding technologies and frameworks, understanding the process, knowing what you need to do and how you should do it, as well as respecting set deadlines As I already said &#8211; it’s about being able to deliver the project from start to finish without having someone constantly looking over your shoulder.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_fajdetic_coconut_origin_body01-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-3686" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_fajdetic_coconut_origin_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_fajdetic_coconut_origin_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_fajdetic_coconut_origin_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_fajdetic_coconut_origin_body01.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>What do you mean by upgrading processes? Give us some examples… </h4>



<p>Well, for example, this can be anything from upgrading our tech stack and incorporating new tools to updating our internal wiki and creating better or faster way we can gather knowledge. There are various processes between mobile and design teams &#8211; from the way specific screens are designed to handover between our teams. We currently have one way of doing it, but there’s maybe a better way &#8211; we can maybe use some other tools or some of the steps might be done faster. The same is with our cooperation with the back-end team &#8211; we can maybe create better API routes, upgrade the way we handle documentation…</p>



<p>Of course, these upgrades don’t have to be internal. As an iOS developer, you can propose upgrades that’ll make our clients’ projects better, aspects or features that would be better for users of a certain app, or even help our clients reach their business goals faster &#8211; there are countless possibilities.</p>



<h4>Why do you place such a high emphasis on it?</h4>



<p>Because iOS is constantly changing &#8211; elements are being upgraded, new tools and frameworks are introduced, trends are changing, new devices are constantly coming out. You can’t just sit and do your thing without taking into account what’s going on in the ecosystem &#8211; you’ll be outdated in a year. And everyone else will be far ahead of you. That’s just the state of iOS, and mobile, at this moment.</p>



<h4>Last one. What would you say to anyone who’s thinking about joining Bornfight and the iOS team? </h4>



<p>If you like to work on challenging applications that will enable you to quickly grow your skills and expertise, this is the right place. You’ll have the chance to grow both personally and professionally &#8211; work on projects, upgrade the entire iOS team, guide others and help them grow, and have fun doing it.  </p>



<h4>Well, OK… that’s it then. Recording done!</h4>

<h3>After being named the ‘2018 User’s Choice Agency of the Year’ at the annual Awwwards conference in Amsterdam, we now got the honor to design and develop the entire <a href="https://annual.awwwards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="annual voting website (opens in a new tab)">annual voting website</a>.</h3>



<p>Every year, Awwwards’ panel of specialists (formed by some of the most important designers, creative directors, developers and agencies in the industry), chooses the best of the web &#8211; best websites, web designers, developers, creatives and agencies. This year, in addition to once again being nominated for the Agency of the Year (btw. feel free to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="vote for us (opens in a new tab)" href="https://annual.awwwards.com/categories/agency-of-the-year" target="_blank">vote for us</a>), we also had the honor to create the voting website. To tell us more about the process behind the creation of this web, we sat down with Martina and Karlo, our Strategic Partnerships Executive and Front-end Development Team Lead.</p>



<h4>The website is live, it works great. Give me a short overview of the project before we dig deeper…</h4>



<p><strong>MARTINA:</strong><br>I mean, this is the website for Awwwards &#8211; it’s for the best of the web. This is literally the website where the world’s top designers, developers and creatives will go and vote for other designers, developers, agencies and websites they believe were the absolute best in 2019. So yeah, you could say we had quite a bit of incentive to deliver and overdeliver.</p>


<div style="padding: 55% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/385483345?quality=720p&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p></p>



<h4>OK, OK. Let’s start from the beginning. The Awwwards team contacted us and asked if we’d create this web for them. What happened next? </h4>



<p><strong>MARTINA:<br></strong>There was a lot of hype and a lot of excitement, and we were all ready to jump right in. But we needed to be smart about the process because the website needed to be live in approximately a month and a half from the time they contacted us. </p>



<p><strong>KARLO:<br></strong>As soon as they contacted us, I said that I’m in. This is one of those projects that pushes you to go all in &#8211; and then you go even further because it’s for Awwwards.</p>



<p><strong>MARTINA:<br></strong>We started by organizing an internal sync to determine the team that’ll work on this project and to go over the entire specification. As I said, the time was our only limiting factor, but it was a large one, so we first defined the elements and functionalities that were the top priority &#8211; ones that were a must for the website to be able to function. After that, we defined the ones where we could go big, experiment and really make that wow effect.</p>



<p><strong>KARLO:<br></strong>Exactly, this project was full of aspects that gave everyone on the team a chance to experiment, learn something new and push their expertise even further. As Martina said, the only constraint we had was the time.</p>



<h4>Great. What was the next step? </h4>



<p><strong>MARTINA:<br></strong>After that initial setup and planning, we focused on creating the concept, as well as the design of the website. Hrvoje spearheaded the design process and the concept he came up with revolved around strong, atypical typography &#8211; it was really eye-catching as it isn’t something you’d expect to see on a website, so it has an immediate effect on web visitors. </p>



<p>Another element that was defined during this phase was the color coding on the website. As the website has a couple of distinct units connected to specific categories of awards, we made every unit unique when it comes to color. And when that concept was approved, we pushed on with production.</p>


<div style="padding: 55% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/385483370?quality=720p&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p></p>



<h4>Now we know a little bit about the design aspect. Karlo, tell me about the technology you used?</h4>



<p><strong>KARLO:<br></strong>This was a fun one as we really decided to go all in with this project, and we updated all of our frameworks and plugins to the latest versions before we started. Now, in most situations, this wouldn’t be a problem, but when you combine the deadline we had with the fact that a lot of those new versions were major updates that changed a lot of functionalities we used on a daily basis… yeah, it was fun.</p>



<p>Now that you know the context, this is the tech we used.<br>Vue.js was our main front-end framework and we also used quite a bit of TypeScript. And to animate the elements, we used GSAP (the latest version which was, of course, heavily changed in comparison to the previous one).</p>



<h4>Let’s switch it up a bit. What was the cooperation with the Awwwards team like?</h4>



<p><strong>MARTINA:<br></strong>Yeah, I was in direct communication with them most of the time, and I have to agree &#8211; it was very streamlined. We opened a Slack channel, put everyone in it and practiced open communication right from the start &#8211; through Slack, anyone can contact anyone and get the answers ASAP. Because the deadline was short, and there wasn’t a very large number of people on the project, we decided to speed up communication and skip the ‘main point of contact’ approach as much as possible &#8211; and this was the ideal solution.</p>



<p>Also, I think the entire hype about the project, both from our side and theirs, really helped this project a lot. There were a lot of things we needed to do, the deadline was looming and it was a bit overwhelming and quite intense at times, but that Slack channel was filled with hype &#8211; we all just boosted and motivated each other.</p>



<h4>How did the time constraints affect the project?</h4>



<p><strong>KARLO:<br></strong>I could talk about different paths we might have taken if we had more time, or different technologies we might have used or the general scope of the project &#8211; yeah, if we had more time, the website would probably be better. But when I look at the big picture, time constraints on this project mostly affected our decision-making process. It needed to be much faster and we had to move quickly through the process, so we stacked all positions with senior members to achieve maximum efficiency.</p>


<div style="padding: 55% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/385483396?quality=720p&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p></p>



<h4>When you look at the web and the entire project, what aspect are you most proud of?</h4>



<p><strong>MARTINA:</strong><br>The best part is most certainly the way we approached the production process &#8211; from the initial contact to launch. As I already said, we were very smart about it, focused on the right functionalities and created a website that performs great and looks amazing. It really has that unexpected, exciting vibe to it, and that really takes it to a higher level.</p>



<p><strong>KARLO:</strong><br>Color changes we implemented on the website through global CSS variables are something I’m really proud of because they’re really impactful. Another element, or a set of elements that are also great are text effects we added &#8211; everything from changing text color to background color when you move through the page and shadows. Those kinds of experimental elements really boost the wow effect of the page, but I’m more proud of the smoothness, fluidity and performance we achieved. </p>



<h4>OK, last one. Is there anything else you’d like to mention?</h4>



<p><strong>KARLO:<br></strong>I have to say that the entire team was amazing, every single person gave their maximum &#8211; from designers who really did amazing things with this concept and our software developers who made sure this web will work even if it becomes overloaded. But Martina really deserves a standing ovation. She handled everything, from internal communication, external communication, project management, boosting motivation, pushing new ideas, making sure we’re on the right track… she had everything under control.</p>



<p><strong>MARTINA:<br></strong>First and foremost, big props to the team. What we achieved is really amazing, the way we worked together through all of the challenges was almost picture perfect. Also, I have to say thanks to the Awwwards team who gave us the opportunity to create this great web and for being an amazing support.</p>



<h4>And we’re done!</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>PROGRESS brought together a number of experts and leaders from various companies and industries who shared their experiences with using digital products, apps and software to upgrade their businesses.</h3>
<p>In today’s day and age, digital products such as <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/services/custom-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom software</a>, enterprise tools, mobile applications and websites are rapidly becoming a crucial element that makes businesses more flexible, efficient, profitable or just overall better. Relying on traditional processes and ways of doing things is no longer a viable option if you want your business to achieve that coveted 10x growth.</p>
<h4>Growing businesses by leveraging advanced digital solutions</h4>
<p>With that in mind, we organized the first PROGRESS meetup &#8211; we wanted to bring together industry experts and leaders from a variety of different companies to share their knowledge, experiences and insights they gained by using advanced digital solutions to upgrade their businesses.</p>
<p>The event itself attracted more than 40 people who were very interested to learn how experts from companies like British American Tobacco, Camping Village Šimuni, KING ICT, Ulix Travel and many others used digital solutions to streamline their day to day operations, enhanced business processes and made their companies much more competitive on the market.</p>
<h4>Digital transforming performance and culture in a traditional industry</h4>
<p>The first part of the event revolved around the keynote presentation by John Brady, Marketing Director of British American Tobacco Adria, in which he explained how BAT tackled the process of implementing digital solutions into their business. For them, everything started with a Digital Academy &#8211; a series of educations about the digital landscape, technologies, platforms and opportunities that lie within that digital ecosystem.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4239" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p><strong>“One of the big problems of traditional FMCGs is that you have very talented people, but if you’re not careful, you could see the world pass them by in terms of digital technologies and skills.” &#8211; John Brady / British American Tobacco</strong></p>
<p>Those educations were the first step of their digital journey as they enabled members of BAT Adria to organize and start a large variety of digital activities in-house. By getting knowledge from industry experts and creating a setup for digital activities in-house, they could more easily spread digital through the entire corporation &#8211; it started small, through social media and creating content, but it quickly led to leveraging the power of more advanced digital solutions, like <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/services/mobile-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile applications</a>.</p>
<p><strong>“When we had the basics in place, our people started becoming more comfortable with digital. And it allowed us to look at problems and solutions very differently, a little bit more creative.” &#8211; John Brady / British American Tobacco</strong></p>
<p>By getting involved with digital and taking on more complex digital projects, members of BAT Adria were able to quickly identify new areas of their business that could benefit from digital solutions. Internal communication was one of those areas &#8211; with a lot of employees spread across different markets, communication started getting more and more complex. Using traditional means of communication proved ineffective, so BAT decided to upgrade the way they communicate internally with a mobile application &#8211; <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/work/beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BEYOND</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4240" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>That was the first step that soon led to a creation of a series of mobile applications, with one set of helping them to organize their internal processes and make the entire corporation more efficient, and the other ensuring that BAT and their products are more competitive on the market.</p>
<p><strong>“This has been highly successful for us &#8211; allowing us to expand, giving more value to our customers and bringing something new that our competition wasn’t able to do.” &#8211; John Brady / British American Tobacco</strong></p>
<h4>Using digital products to improve business results of large companies</h4>
<p>In the second part of the PROGRESS event, we switched to a panel discussion during which Mia Pavelić (Executive Director of Camping Village Šimuni), Davor Banović (Test Lead at KING ICT), Anđelko Ćalušić (Founder of Ulix Travel) and Tomislav Grubišić (CEO of Bornfight) talked about the ways how different types of digital solutions can be used to achieve growth in different industries.</p>
<p>As members of large companies that constantly use digital solutions and rely on them to reach their goals and expand their businesses, our panelists discussed how can digital lead to a 10x growth, as well as about the growing importance of digital in the field of business.</p>
<p><strong>“In our business, transformation was about creating a new mindset. Bornfight worked with us and pushed us to detect problems and to really see them as problems. And then to implement changes that would solve them. When you approach transformation in that way, you stop labeling it as transformation, but as a logical next step. ” &#8211; Mia Pavelić / Camping Village Šimuni</strong></p>
<p>As the panelists started digging deeper into the topic of digital transformation, Davor Banović pinpointed one of the key elements that prevent companies from implementing digital solutions into their businesses &#8211; having a set of people who keep using traditional solutions alongside digital ones.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4241" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body03.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p><strong>“Digital transformation is a process that takes time. But actually getting people to let go of old ways of doing things is the real challenge. There are still government offices that require you to go there and bring physical contracts, even though you used their official online form and sent them the exact same contract. But one is digital, and the other is not &#8211; and that’s the problem.” &#8211; Davor Banović / KING ICT</strong></p>
<p>Anđelko Ćalušić quickly built on that with his example. He mentioned that digital transformation starts by teaching people the simplest of activities, like showing people how to manage data through an Excel sheet. Even though it might seem to us that using Excel isn’t particularly digital as a majority of us have used it for quite some time, in a lot of traditional companies, Excel is a novelty &#8211; and it can be used as a first step to digitalization.</p>
<p><strong>“I believe every one of us has a responsibility to start digitizing people around us and helping them to understand the benefits. Starting from something as simple as Google Docs, and then slowly upgrading them to more advanced systems. All of us who have more knowledge have that responsibility to be the enablers of digital transformation.” &#8211; Anđelko Ćalušić / Ulix Travel</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4242" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body04.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body04.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Camping Village Šimuni’s Mia Pavelić then added to Anđelko’s statement by mentioning that a key element of digital transformation was the willingness of the company board and management to go through with it. As Camping Village Šimuni is currently going through that process, she sees how the mindset of the management team impacts the overall implementation of digital into businesses. When the management is amped about embracing digital solutions, employees who usually know a lot more about it become exponentially more motivated to push it through as it directly simplifies and streamlines their work.</p>
<p><strong>“Anyone can say that something is difficult. But you need to be willing to implement changes and then invest your time to learn how to get the most benefits out of them.” &#8211; Mia Pavelić / Camping Village Šimuni</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4243" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body05.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body05.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_progress_body05-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>To close the discussion, Tomislav Grubišić touched upon the next logical step in digital transformation and what he believes will be one of the main ways that businesses will be able to achieve 10x growth &#8211; using digital to transform company services or processes into products, tools, software or apps that can be sold to other companies.</p>
<p><strong>“It doesn’t even have to be the entire process or an entire service. You can actually take a small part of the process or service that is specific enough to make a difference for the company it’s used in &#8211; you then digitize it and turn it into a product that can be used by all similar companies or companies within the same industry.” &#8211; Tomislav Grubišić / Bornfight</strong></p>
<p>Tomislav continued to explain how scaling a business can be extremely difficult and expensive, sometimes even impossible. Imagine a factory that has a limited space to expand, when it reaches that limit, the goal of achieving 10x growth quickly becomes unachievable. Turning the service or a process or even just a part of it into a digital product, an app or software that can be sold to others can help scale the business beyond those limitations.</p>

<p><strong>“The key is just to find that single element &#8211; that core part that can be turned in a crucial element of someone else’s business.” &#8211; Tomislav Grubišić / Bornfight</strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>In this edition of Digging Deeper, we sat down with Karlo, a Team Lead in our Front-end Development department, and got him to tell us more about what Front-end Development is like at Bornfight.</h3>
<p>__________<br />
<strong>Want to become a part of our Front-end team? Check out all open positions!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bornfight.com/careers/front-end-developer-m-f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Front-end Developer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>__________</p>
<h4>OK, Karlo. First question &#8211; let&#8217;s get straight to the point. What do Front-end Developers do at Bornfight, what&#8217;s your main focus?</h4>
<p>OK, to keep it short and to the point. I always like to say that the work of a Front-end Developer fully revolves around all of the aspects that users can see in the browser. Regardless if we&#8217;re talking about a <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/services/advanced-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, a web application or the entire UI &#8211; if an element can be seen by a user in a browser, you know a Front-end Developer had to create it based on design.</p>
<h4>When you say &#8216;based on design&#8217;, what do you mean?</h4>
<p>That means we get a static file from our design team, and our job is to make it alive. Everything from the layout, typography, animations, transitions&#8230; Every element that&#8217;s visible on that static file we receive from design &#8211; we Front-end Developers need to turn them into code. And that act of turning elements into code through HTML, CSS and JavaScript is what &#8216;makes it alive&#8217; within the browser.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4208" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>You mentioned HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Are those the only technologies you use?</h4>
<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the main client-side technologies. That means they are in most cases our primary focus and our go-to technologies when it comes to choosing the right ones for the project. They are extremely versatile and enable us to create anything within the browser, so I believe that having experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a must.</p>
<p>Yeah, for Front-end projects we mostly work on, like advanced &#8216;creative&#8217; websites, everything revolves around these three technologies.</p>
<h4>Creative websites &#8211; what do you mean by that?</h4>
<p>OK, we call them creative websites at Bornfight, but a more detailed description for this would be websites whose goal is to provide users with a special kind of experience. Whether it&#8217;s through animations, user interactions, 3D presentations or any other type of &#8216;creative&#8217; approach &#8211; the goal is always to create something different, something that will make the users say wow and leave them wondering how that was created.</p>
<h4>Could, for example, e-commerce websites that are primarily focused on conversion fall under this &#8216;creative&#8217; category?</h4>
<p>Of course, there is always a way to turn the process of buying a product into a great experience. And users expect it. Receiving a product is just a part of the overall experience &#8211; the other part is visiting the website, exploring, reading about products&#8230; And that became just as important as getting the product in the mail. That&#8217;s something we did for <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/work/wolaco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WOLACO</a> some time ago &#8211; they are a great sports apparel brand with a great brand story, and we used the entire website to tell it to the world.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4210" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>So, when we talk about those &#8216;creative&#8217; project, are we talking exclusively about websites or is there something more?</h4>
<p>At the time, yes. You see, our Front-end department is divided into two groups &#8211; one part of the team works on digital products and the other part works on those &#8216;creative&#8217; projects. And a majority of those projects revolve around creating really advanced websites. From time to time, we tackle something more complex like <a href="https://ascc.bornfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interactive applications</a>, and that is certainly a type of projects we&#8217;ll work on more in the future, but websites are our strong point and the type of projects where we have the most experience.</p>
<h4>Let&#8217;s switch it up a bit. Tell me a bit about your Team Lead position.</h4>
<p>Well, as a team lead, I&#8217;m mostly focused on the entire creative part of Bornfight&#8217;s Front-end Development. That primarily revolves around taking care of projects and making sure they&#8217;re up to our standard, as well as mentoring people who work on that type of projects and making sure they can grow both professionally and personally.</p>
<h4>Nice. Tell me how do you inspire yourself. What sources do you follow?</h4>
<p>Ever since I started with Front-end Development, I&#8217;ve been going through all of the new websites that won site of the day on Awwwards, FWA, CSS Design Awards&#8230; That&#8217;s my main source of inspiration and motivation. I just love seeing what people across the world are doing within this field &#8211; I love inspecting all of the single elements, trying to find out how others made them work, what challenges they needed to solve, what new trends or technologies are they implementing&#8230; I believe following what&#8217;s going on in the industry is really important if a Front-end Developer wants to stay on top of its game.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4211" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body03.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>Great. Let&#8217;s go a bit deeper. What are your expectation from other members of the Front-end team?</h4>
<p>You know how they say &#8211; I&#8217;m strict, but fair. Man, that sounds so cheesy. OK, let&#8217;s keep it serious &#8211; the most important element I expect from other team members is that everyone gives their max. That is my number 1 priority. As a mentor and a team lead, I&#8217;ll do my best to help them get enough knowledge and experience needed to work on projects, and I&#8217;ll also help them meet the quality standards we are always going for, but that mindset of wanting to push forward and dig deeper when you encounter challenges, that&#8217;s what I really appreciate. Yeah, we have deadlines, we have challenging projects&#8230; unpredictable problems can occur, but that mindset of always trying to give their best is what turns good Front-end Developers into excellent ones.</p>
<p>Another thing I expect from other team members is to approach every project as if they were doing it for themselves &#8211; that&#8217;s the thing that leads to people loving their jobs, having fun and ultimately creating something truly amazing. If a person is passionate about their job and enjoys doing it &#8211; I find that even more important than knowing hundreds of technologies or libraries. As I said, that willingness to dig deeper and do the best you can&#8230; that&#8217;s the key!</p>
<h4>If you had to describe the ideal Front-end Developer, what would that person be like?</h4>
<p>Ideal Front-end Developers are first and foremost great team players &#8211; they can share the vision with other members of the team, they are willing to learn and share what they learned with others. They also need to know how to use the right side of the brain and they need to know how to make that creative juices flow. Having an eye for details and a feel for aesthetics is also very important &#8211; we can&#8217;t just code something out and leave it, Front-end Development revolves around creating solutions that are both functional and eye-pleasing.</p>
<p>And the last thing is a critical mindset &#8211; you need to constantly ask questions because that leads to even better solutions!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4212" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body04.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body04.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_dorian_diggingdeeper_front_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>Let&#8217;s switch it up again. What is it that Bornfight can offer new Front-end Developers, why would anyone want to join our Front-end team?</h4>
<p>Well, the most important thing we can offer Front-end Developers is the chance to work on extremely interesting projects that will help them grow their development skills. Projects that will challenge them to learn new ways to approach problems, projects that have a bigger cause, projects that help our clients and partners solve their business problems, and projects that will ultimately help Front-end Developers win various industry-related awards. That&#8217;s the cherry on top &#8211; projects and websites we work on are often named as some of the best worldwide, and getting that recognition from industry-experts is truly an amazing feeling.</p>
<p>These are all the things that drive me personally. When you have a chance to do something great, when that solution you created can help others, and when someone else recognizes just how much you put into that solution. That combination is the ultimate driver, the ultimate push that incites you to do your best on every new project.</p>
<h4>OK, last question. What&#8217;s the vision of the Front-end team, what are some of aspects you&#8217;ll focus on in the next period?</h4>
<p>Well, the vision is to work more on projects that enable us to showcase the full potential of new technologies like 3D and WebGL. Also, we&#8217;ll focus on establishing and optimizing our internal processes &#8211; that will be very important because our team is constantly growing and we need to make sure our processes are as streamlined as possible.</p>
<p>In general, I think that all of us in the team are aligned with the main vision of creating projects that help people and provide them with great experiences. That&#8217;s the main thing that drives our team, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re always looking for new people who want to do the same!</p>
