<h3>To see what’s going on under the hood of a trading platform our development team worked on, we sat down with Marko Kruljac, our Senior Developer and Tech Lead.</h3>



<p>Marko was one of the key people involved in the project, so we got him to tell us more about what makes this advanced crypto platform tick.</p>



<h4>OK, when we first talked about this project, you told me that the entire platform has 6 main components.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Yeah, we developed the platform to have 5 main modules all built around the central one &#8211; Apache Kafka that serves as a sort of a core information highway for the entire platform. Those five main modules are:</p>



<ol><li>Kolektorka</li><li>Deduplikator</li><li>Kasirka</li><li>Streamerka</li><li>Arhiverka</li></ol>



<p>In addition to those 5, we also have 8 supporting modules.</p>



<h4>Let’s focus on those 5 main components and Kafka.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Right, right. Now, how can I describe the architecture of the product so you’ll understand it? OK, imagine a large conveyor belt. And there are boxes being placed on the belt &#8211; and as they travel across they are processed and analyzed, and when they come to the end, you get a finished product.</p>



<p>The first element in this entire process, the one that places the boxes on the conveyor belt is Kolektorka. This module collects information about executed trades and about the state of the order book. These two pieces of information are crucial for the entire platform because we use them to calculate all elements that need to be presented to users. Currently, there are between 120 to 140 Kolektorka modules active inside the platform and they are collecting information from more than 100 crypto exchanges.</p>



<h4>So how do they work?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Basically, we started off with 1 Kolektorka and gave it a list of exchanges it needs to visit and told it what data it needs to ask those exchanges for. When it gets the needed data, it puts it on the conveyor belt (which is Kafka, but we’ll talk about that later).</p>



<p>And that’s generally what this Kolektorka module does. I mean, the entire architecture of the system is built around small, independent, stupid modules doing most of the work, because that’s easy to create, maintain and scale. And Kolektorka is just that &#8211; small, distributed, isolated and stupid.</p>



<h4>When you say stupid…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Stupid means it does only one thing, but it does it extremely well. I say stupid, but maybe the better term would be extremely specialised. You see, there is no special logic behind a module like that. I mean, everything Kolektorka does can be explained in one sentence &#8211; go to the exchange, gather data and send them to Kafka.</p>



<p>It has a defined list of exchanges it needs to visit and exact crypto pairs it needs to gather the data on. We mostly want to collect data on all available pairs from all available exchanges, because the more the better. The more data you have, the more competitive edge you have &#8211; that’s why we want it all.</p>



<p>So yeah, Kolektorka is pretty straightforward &#8211; it gets a task to go to, for example, Bitstamp and collect data on the BTC/USD pair. It knows how to get to Bitstamp and how to ask for the data it needs. You see, exchanges won’t give you data for all pairs at once, so you have to get them one by one. If you need the data about trades, you’ll get the info on all trades executed from the last time you asked for it. If you need the data about the state of the order book, this gets a bit more complicated because the order book can be extremely large, but in general, you just need the top 10 to 20 percent for analysis.</p>



<p>OK, so now you got the info. The thing is, this is all extremely slow because you have hundreds of exchanges and thousands of crypto pairs. If you have just 1 Kolektorka, there’s a way to get data on specific pairs from multiple exchanges at the same time because they don’t communicate with each other, but there’s no way to get data on all pairs from a single exchange because every exchange limits the number of times you can ping their API. They put the limit to secure themselves from DDOS attacks, and it basically means you have to wait anywhere between 2 to 5 seconds between requesting data again.</p>



<p>As I said, that’s extremely slow because we need data in real time. In the initial phases, we solved that problem by brute force. We didn’t have 1 Kolektorka, but 100 with different IP addresses. And one will ask for BTC/USD from exchange A, the other for BTC/EUR from exchange A and so on and so on until we cover all the pairs.</p>



<h4>And when you have 100 Kolektorka modules…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Exactly, you get 100 pieces of data in an instant. Instead of using 1 Kolektorka and waiting 200 seconds to get all the pieces of data you need, with 100 Kolektorka modules you get it all in 1 second.</p>



<p>As I said, when we started, this was the way to solve the problem with exchanges limiting the number of requests we could send, but it all changed some 6 month after we started.</p>



<h4>What happened?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, more and more exchanges started supporting socket technology and they basically said &#8211; don’t ping us every couple of seconds, just connect to our exchange using sockets and we’ll send you the data when any change occurs.</p>



<p>When we started, we had a Kolektorka module constantly sending requests to the exchange &#8211; give me the data, give me the data, give me the data. And most of the time it got the same answer &#8211; nothing changed, nothing changed, nothing changed. That wasted resources for both us and the exchanges. Now, with sockets, you don’t have to constantly send requests and ping exchanges, because they send you the info you need at the exact moment something happens.</p>



<h4>I’m sensing a ‘but’ here…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> But… it wasn’t so simple. You see, we had to reprogram the modules to support that. The initial ones were all Rest Kolektorka modules and they were super simple to develop because you had a complete library you could use &#8211; it was plug and play, and it worked perfectly. When we wanted to turn them into Socket Kolektorka modules, we had to code them from scratch for every single exchange.</p>

<h4>Let me guess, every exchange has something special and different, which makes the process extremely difficult?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Exactly! None of them work like you’d expect. They are all special in their own nasty way, and that made our job so much harder. I mean, there were situations where there was absolutely no documentation on how to connect to them using sockets and even less on getting them to send you the data you need. But we did it &#8211; developed it from scratch for all the exchanges that supported it.</p>



<h4>So what does it mean for the system?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, you no longer need to have 100 Kolektorka modules to connect to 100 exchanges because you’re not limited and don’t have to wait. You can have 20 modules beacause each one can easily connect to 5 exchanges and get info from them. And all it has to do is receive data and send to Kafka. This was the ideal solution because we get the data in an instant and we don’t waste resources on constant pinging.</p>



<h4>OK, but then why do we still have 100 Kolektorka modules in the system?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Backup. We have them for backup, and because not all exchanges support sockets. And the thing is that we want to collect data from all exchanges.</p>



<h4>Got it. Are we done with Kolektorka?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, we just covered the trades. Kolektorka also collects data on order books, and that’s a whole other beast. Size-wise. See, one trade is about 15 kilobytes, while an order book has hundreds of orders on the left side and hundreds on the right. And you have to collect them all, for all crypto pairs and from all exchanges. That’s more than 15,000 unique markets.</p>



<h4>And that’s all Kolektorka’s job?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Exactly. It needs to continuously collect order books, but that’s not 15 kilobytes, it’s more like 200. And that can fill up the available space pretty fast. But the thing with order books is that, although they’re large, they change rarely. For example, if you view it at T=0 and then T=0+0,5 seconds &#8211; only a couple of top rows have changed. Everything else remained the same.</p>



<p>This is where we did an awesome little thing to optimize everything &#8211; instead of sending the entire order book to Kafka every single time, Kolektorka sends it just the first time and identifies it as an original. And then just sends the data that’s different from that original &#8211; basically patching the order book every time it receives new data. And the best thing is that each of these patches is 5 kilobytes.</p>



<p>By doing that we compressed the data, saved terabytes of space every week and made everything work even smoother. And that’s that when it comes to Kolektorka.</p>



<h4>Nice, onto the next one!</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> OK, the next element on our conveyor belt is the Deduplikator.<br>You see, Kolektorka modules are redundant &#8211; there are 4 to 5 of them that collect the same things at the same time. Now I know what you’re gonna ask &#8211; why do you need 5 copies of the same data? Well, what if one Kolektorka dies, what if its IP gets banned, what if there’s a power outage &#8211; whatever it may be, you still have other sources active. The data must go on. Get it.</p>



<p>As great as that is, it also leaves us with a ton of duplicate data. That’s where Deduplikator comes into play. Just as I said about Kolektorka, it’s also a stupid module. Its task is to be a gatekeeper &#8211; to only let the new data pass through, while blocking duplicates.</p>



<h4>OK, how does it work?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, it’s like this. If you want to build your own Google that could browse only one website &#8211; that’s super simple. But if you want to develop one that could browse the entire internet, well that’s a multi-billion dollar project.<br>Creating a Deduplikator module that would remove duplicates from one exchange &#8211; piece of cake. Develop one that would deduplicate terabytes of data…</p>



<h4>Mission impossible…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Let’s just say that you need a really, really smart solution to do something like that. And we managed to find that solution in Redis.</p>



<p>It’s a database whose main feature is that it’s extremely fast because it doesn’t save data on the disk, but on RAM. And it’s a crucial element of deduplication. The Deduplikator module reads the info about a trade and lets it pass, and then goes to Redis and says something like: “Hey there Redis, i just let this trade go through under this key (the key consists of the exchange name, exact crypto pair and the ID of the trade). If the trade with this same key comes again, remind me that I’ve already let it through because I can’t remember that stuff.”</p>



<p>As I said, Deduplikator is also a stupid module &#8211; it does only one thing extremely well and can’t do anything else. Deduplikator can let data go through and inform Redis about the key, but it can’t know what exactly it let through. And that works perfectly.</p>



<p>Now, there’s a little caveat &#8211; there’s 50 gigabytes of data on Redis, which means you need 100 gigabytes of RAM to make it work. And RAM can be expensive if you plan on storing all that data. That’s why we decided to optimize the whole thing and said OK Redis, you need periodically delete all data that’s older than 1 week if we want this to be stable. And like I already said a couple of times &#8211; this also works perfectly.</p>



<p>Here’s what we’re thinking &#8211; if it’s been more than a week, nobody’s going to collect that data again, and there will be nothing to deduplicate. It’s old news. I mean, we could collect data from the last three years, but if you know you’ll never get duplicate data, you don’t need it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-scaled.jpg?x22406" alt="Software developer working on a laptop - Bornfight Custom Software Development" class="wp-image-5104" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/header-bornfight-custom-software-development-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<h4>But that’s just the trades…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Right, that was the easy part. Deduplicating order books was a hell of a job. Deduplicating trades is simple because you have a key &#8211; exchange, pair, trade ID. If it’s new, let it pass. If it matches, throw it out.</p>



<p>But order books, oh boy. You have 100 Kolektorka modules that see the same or just slightly different order book, and they all pass that information at the same time. And now your job is to figure out the timeline and rebuild the order book. You need to figure out what’s the truth, and what that order book really looks like &#8211; and only 1 way is the correct one.</p>



<h4>Now wait a minute, how come Kolektorka modules don’t have the exact time when a piece of data was collected?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> They do, but it’s the job of a Deduplikator module to take them all together and put them in the correct order. You see, sometimes delivery can be a little late, and when you receive hundreds of pieces of data every second, being a little late can mess up the system.</p>



<h4>OK, so how did you solve it?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, Redis did most of the heavy lifting. But the thing is that you can never have it fully correct. There’s always that fraction of a percent that might be wrong and you have to live with it. But it’s easy to live with it because that fraction of a percent…</p>



<h4>It’s practically irrelevant in a couple of seconds because of the sheer amount of data that the system collects.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Exactly, spot on. Basically, the Deduplikator module get all those snapshots of different parts of the order book, takes them all together and recreates one uniform information that it sends through. It’s extremely complicated, but it works. You got rid of duplicates, you solved the problem with the disk and you solved the problem of having to do the same thing over and over and over again. And this leads us to our next big module.</p>



<h4>Kasirka?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Now that we have all that data, we have to do something smart with it. And we are, although the module that does it is again very stupid, or extremely specialized as we said before.</p>



<p>Kasirka is a module that does technical trade analysis &#8211; that’s a set of mathematical functions and formulas that, when coupled with trade information, give you metrics, and additional data that can help you with creating trading strategies. One of the most basic examples of this would be a simple moving average &#8211; a graph showing the price through time. This was just an example, Kasirka does a wide variety of simple and much more complex analysis.</p>



<p>The great thing about developing this was that we didn’t have to do it from scratch &#8211; there’s a full library we could just connect and implement &#8211; it’s called TA-Lib, technical analysis library. It’s written in C, which means it’s extremely fast, and it’s basically a black box. We can, for example, say that we need an RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator &#8211; we input the data, TA-Lib does its magic, we get the numbers we need and send them through our conveyor belt. This library makes it as simple as that.</p>



<p>Now let’s get into a little bit more detail. Kasirka is not one module, it’s basically three &#8211; there’s a Candle Maker Kasirka, Technical Analysis Kasirka and Index Kasirka. The first one on our conveyor belt is the Candle Maker kasirka &#8211; it just receives trade data and aggregates them in 10 different time intervals, starting with 1 minute. It aggregates, it makes its calculations and then it sends the data to Kafka. That’s all it does, and that’s extremely important because its output is the input that Technical Analysis Kasirka and Index Kasirka need to perform their tasks.</p>



<p>The great thing about the Kasirka module is that it’s fully scalable. Let’s say you have 100 pairs you need to analyze &#8211; if you have 1 Kasirka it will analyze all of the pairs. If you have 2 Kasirka modules, they’ll organize themselves through kafka and each one will analyze 50 pairs. If you have a 100 of them, each will analyze 1 pair. There are no limits, it’s infinitely scalable.</p>



<h4>How many Kasirka modules are currently in the system?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> There are 50 modules and the whole thing works extremely smoothly.</p>



<h4>OK, what’s next?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Well, I think it’s finally time we tackle that Kafka element we’ve been talking about from the beginning. Kafka is basically the core of that conveyor belt. It’s LinkedIn’s distributed system for communication and delivering messages, and it’s the only component that we didn’t develop from scratch &#8211; we just took the entire solution, configured it, installed it, connected everything, turned it on and it worked like a charm.</p>



<p>The main thing Kafka enabled us to do is scale the entire system. Whenever you need to upgrade the system, you simply add new nodes (they call them Brokers) that can receive and send new messages. You just add a couple of pieces of new hardware and you’re good &#8211; that was benefit #1. The other benefit was that Kafka also enabled us to infinitely scale all our modules &#8211; all because of Kafka’s simple technique called partitioning.</p>



<p>Imagine our conveyor belt divided into three parts, with little barriers between them. Now you don’t have one single person working on the entire belt, but three different people, and each one of them has to take care of the boxes only on their part of the belt. That means you can send three boxes at the same time, and all three will be analyzed at the same time. And this partitioning option isn’t limited to three &#8211; it enables you to divide the conveyor belt and increase the number of modules as much as you need. It was the ideal solution for the system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4728" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter.jpg 2048w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_kovacic_php_74_twitter-1536x768.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></figure>



<h4>It was basically a plug &amp; play solution?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> I’d say plug &amp; pray. You see, none of us worked with Kafka before, so we kind of winged it. We rented a bunch of machines on Amazon Web Services, installed Kafka and tried different things until it worked. You see, although the technology has been around for some time, Kafka just recently gained some traction. This means there are limited resources online, so working with it is basically a trial &amp; error process. And after a lot of that trial &amp; error, we ended with the right solution we implemented into the final platform.</p>



<p>And that’s basically it, that’s Kafka. I mean, I could talk for hours about it, we could make a whole series about that single component…</p>



<h4>But it’s time to cover the final two modules.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Yes, Arhiverka and Streamerka. Let’s start with Arhiverka.<br>What you need to know about our conveyor belt is that it’s flat and that it has an end. And when a box comes to the end, it just hangs on there for some time, until other boxes push it of the ledge. Now, if those boxes aren’t opened, analyzed and stored before they fall of the belt, the data they’re carrying is lost. So if you need some data from three months ago, well tough luck.</p>



<p>But that’s why we have Arhiverka. This module basically archives all of the boxes &#8211; it takes them from the belt, makes an exact copy and saves it in its database. And you need that because you need access to historical data.</p>



<p>So you have the streaming platform which gives you current, real-time data. And you have Historical which shows you how the markets changed through time.</p>



<h4>So, for how long is it stored?</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> How long? Indefinitely. It’s cold storage.</p>



<h4>That’s a whole lot of data…</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Yeah, that’s a whole lot of data. Last I checked, there were 700 million database inputs. And that’s some. Give me a quick second to crunch the numbers… That’s some 13 gigabytes per minute. I eyeballed it, it’s a napkin calculation. I could be wrong, but I think this is more or less somewhere around the correct number.</p>



<p>So yeah, it’s a whole lot of data. Enormous, just enormous amount of data being collected every day. And when you know that each piece of data is just a couple of kilobytes, the entire thing is even more amazing. While we were testing the platform during the development, we filled 5 terabytes in about 2 weeks.</p>



<h4>Damn, that’s… I don’t even know what to say. While I wrap my head around this, tell me more about the last module.</h4>



<p><strong>MARKO:</strong> Ah yes, Streamerka. Amazing module.<br>Streamerka is actually data streaming as a service, and its task is to be the interface for customers. This is the module that enables them to connect to the system and to receive data about crypto pairs from exchanges.</p>



<p>By using Streamerka, users can subscribe to get information about trades, order books, technical indicators, candles, indexes. Users can even subscribe to get news and sentiment &#8211; they can see whether the crypto community has positive or negative feeling about certain cryptocurrencies. For example, users may want to get information about all pairs available on Bitstamp, or maybe they just want to get info about BTC/USD, but from all exchanges. Due to the amount of raw data the system collects from more than 100 exchanges, the possibilities to get personalized information and analyses are endless.</p>



<p>The entire system is, of course, built on socket technology, so users don’t have to constantly ping the system. They just need to subscribe to the information they want to receive and the system delivers it to them in real time. They just need to have an active subscription.</p>



<p>And I believe that’s it. We covered them all &#8211; Kafka as the main central highway, the conveyor belt of our story, and 5 key modules that collect, analyze and distribute data.</p>

<h3>In the last 2 years, 90% of the world’s data has been created and businesses are spending more than $180 billion a year on big data analysis.</h3>



<p>Even though the numbers are high, there are still companies that don’t use this as an opportunity to start investing in Big Data. If you are one of them &#8211; take a look at how some of the big guys are doing it and how it’s giving them an advantage on the market.</p>



<h4>But before we start &#8211; what exactly is Big Data?</h4>



<p><strong>(and how is it different from “small” data)</strong></p>



<p>The term Big Data has been around for some time now, but it has taken a whole new meaning today when people share 500 terabytes of data per day just on Facebook. And on YouTube, there are over 300 hours of video shared every minute!</p>



<p><strong>Based on those facts, we can say that users are constantly offering their data to companies. But why do companies need so much data?</strong></p>



<p>Data can help them with many things, but most importantly, it can help them identify new business opportunities which can generate more sales and create a better customer experience. It also makes decision-making faster and solving problems more efficient.</p>



<p><strong>As for the difference between Big Data and the rest of data &#8211; it lies within the 5 Vs.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Volume</li><li>Velocity</li><li>Variety</li><li>Veracity</li><li>Value</li></ul>



<p><strong>When it comes to volume, the word itself says it all, Big Data is exactly that &#8211; big.<br></strong>When we talk about velocity, we talk about how fast we can gather the data we need &#8211; it is incredibly important to have real-time data at any time to make better business decisions faster.</p>



<p><strong>Once we’ve accumulated data, we need to understand the different types of data there are (variety).</strong></p>



<h5>When we talk about Big Data, we talk about its three forms:</h5>



<ul><li><strong>Structured <br></strong>Which is easy to store and analyze, and which can be created by a machine or by humans (accounts for up to 20% of all of the collected data).<br>Examples: address details, numerical ratings by customers, demographic information…</li><li><strong>Unstructured</strong><br>It’s more difficult to analyze and search for and, even though it accounts for a much larger percentage, people usually disregarded it &#8211; until AI was able to make it easier to process.<br>Examples: photos, videos, audio, social media content, open-ended surveys…</li><li><strong>Semi-structured</strong><br>This is a mix of structured and unstructured data. It includes parts that can be easily organized, but it also includes data that is hard for a machine to sort out.<br>Example: an email message — unstructured data is the text within the email, while structured data includes the name of the recipient, time sent, email address of the sender…</li></ul>



<p>Once you have the data, it needs to pass a credibility and quality test (Veracity), and last but not least the data needs to be useful for your business &#8211; it needs to give you information that will provide some benefits to your business (Value).</p>



<p><strong>Now that you know the traditional explanation of what Big Data really is, the best way to actually understand it is to see how it works in real life. Let’s take a look at how some of the world’s largest brands made Big Data a part of their core business.</strong></p>



<h4>Amazon</h4>



<p>Amazon is definitely the number 1 e-commerce shop at the moment and they have their database to thank for that. They are constantly using big data to improve their customer experience, so here are two examples that show just how well that works.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5958" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h5>Dynamic pricing</h5>



<p>Everybody knows that airlines use this tactic when selling plane tickets &#8211; if you check out the same tickets over and over again, it probably means you really want them and are willing to pay more for them. That same logic is implemented on Amazon’s website. But what you probably didn’t know is that they change their prices up to 2,5 million times a day.</p>



<p><strong>What affects these price changes are factors like shopping patterns, competitor’s prices, and whether the product is a common one or not.</strong></p>



<h5>Product recommendations</h5>



<p>It doesn’t matter if the person buys the products, puts it in the cart or even just takes a look at it &#8211; Amazon will use that data. That way they can learn what each customer wants and likes, and can recommend that same product or similar ones to them when they return to the shop.</p>



<p><strong>This is how the company earns 35% of their annual sales.</strong></p>



<h4>The Marriott hotels</h4>



<p>Hospitality industry has been growing in the last few years and will definitely continue to grow. The Marriott hotels, one of the biggest hotel chains in the world, are one of the leaders in the industry, so let’s take a look at how they use Big Data to generate more revenue and gain more loyal customers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5959" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body02-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>Just like Amazon, Starwood hotels (one of the brands under Marriott hotels) also use dynamic pricing. It is changing based on a variety of factors such as local and global economic situation, weather, availability and reservation behavior, cancellations and many others &#8211; this tactic resulted in a 5% revenue increase per room.</p>



<p><strong>They go so deep with utilizing data that they even follow if famous musicians are playing at the Madison Square Garden so they could adjust their rates at their nearby hotels.</strong></p>



<p>To create a better customer experience, they also started testing out facial recognition check-ins which looks like a win-win scenario &#8211; their guests don’t need to wait at the reception desk anymore, and the hotel gathers even more valuable information. Another element they implemented to gather data is putting Amazon Echos into the rooms &#8211; this allows guests to make Alexa handle everything that was previously handled by the reception staff. Now guests can get all the information they want, while Marriott gets the knowledge of their customer’s preferences, needs and potential concerns.</p>



<h4>Netflix</h4>



<p>Netflix is unarguably the biggest online platform for streaming movies and TV shows, and it owes its success to Big Data. Because they know their users, their retention rate is 93% which, compared to their main competitors, is a huge number. They are also growing rapidly because of their original movies and TV shows that just show that they actually listen to their consumers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5960" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body03-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>And because of that, this year they were able to compete with traditional giants and win two Golden Globes and two Oscars. And it looks like this is just the beginning!</p>



<p><strong>So, how do they use their data to create such a good customer experience?<br></strong>They collect data such as the time during which their subscribers watch the show, if they binge-watched it or it took them some time to finish, did they pause the show and if they resumed it after pausing…</p>



<p><strong>And all of this is used to create personalized accounts for each consumer!</strong></p>



<p>Their goal is the ultimate personalization and that is clearly shown through their plans for the future which include using AI to create trailers &#8211; because why should everybody get the same one. They plan on creating trailers that are fully personalized for their viewers &#8211; for example, if a specific user loves romance movies, they are more likely to watch a non-romance movie if the trailer is filled with romantic scenes. And that is just the tip of their plan.</p>



<p>Netflix will be able to achieve this through machine learning, and even though machines still can’t understand human emotions, it is something we can expect in the near future. And when it comes to the bottom line &#8211; this will greatly reduce the cost and time needed to create the trailer and put Netflix on the right path to achieve their goal of ultimate personalization.</p>



<h4>Uber Eats</h4>



<p>For a couple of years, Uber has been the leader in the taxi business and nobody was surprised when they announced they will be expanding their services &#8211; from driving people to delivering food.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5961" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body04-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p><strong>They entered this saturated market of food delivery and, thanks to the data they collected from being a taxi giant, they are here to stay.</strong></p>



<p>They wanted to be recognized as a delivery that always brings food while it is still warm, so they tried to model the physical world in a way that would allow them to be as accurate as possible when predicting the time of food delivery. To make this endeavor work, they also collected the data of how much time it usually takes to prepare a certain meal, so they could pinpoint the exact time when the delivery person should come and pick it up.</p>



<p>This action allows the drivers to pick up more meals on their way (as they don’t have to wait for the food to be prepared) and Uber is encouraging them to carry more than one meal per trip with a bonus for each meal they collect.</p>



<p>This, however, is not something that has never been done before, but by using data, they are doing it better than anyone before. I mena, they are going deep with this that they even employed meteorologists to help them predict what the weather will be like and how it will affect the delivery.</p>



<p><strong>What Uber Eats is doing is a textbook example of how Big Data and data analysis can help businesses expand their services and give them a clear advantage over their competitors.</strong></p>



<h4>McDonald’s</h4>



<p>The food industry and trends are always changing, and if you want to be able to stay at the top, you need to be able to change with them. And that is exactly what McDonald&#8217;s is doing. With the rise of the trend of healthy living and using online ordering, fast food restaurants were faced with a problem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5965" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body07-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p><strong>That is when McDonald’s started to turn to the data they collected over the years. They wanted to transition from mass marketing to mass customization &#8211; in order to do such a thing, they needed to unlock the data in a way that is useful to customers.</strong></p>



<p>What they came up with was a drive-thru with digital menus that change based on a variety of factors &#8211; from the time of the day, to weather, and to historical sales data. That way they can offer their clients a cold beverage on a hot day or maybe a coffee with their breakfast menu.</p>



<h4>Starbucks</h4>



<p>Starbucks is a global brand with a famous logo and the infamous activity of writing wrong names of their customers on cups. As I previously mentioned, personalization is the key to growth nowadays, and that is exactly what Starbucks is doing &#8211; they are using Big Data to create a better customer experience!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5962" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body05-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p><strong>The way they collect data is by providing their customers with Starbucks rewards programs and mobile apps which help them learn more about the buying habits of each of their customers.</strong></p>



<p>Starbucks is then using that data to recommend products to their loyal customers, create better marketing campaigns and new menus, as well as decide where they’ll open their next store. This system is so organized that it will offer their customers products based on the season, weather and location they are at.</p>



<p>They also send out personalized emails with offers to customers who haven’t visited the store in a while, so they can re-engage them or send them discounts.</p>



<h4>Accuweather</h4>



<p>All the companies mentioned above use their data internally, but can big data you have be turned into a service? Well, Accuweather did just that.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5963" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_tudor_bigdata_body06-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<p>In the past, their partners were exclusively global brands, but they realized that many other businesses could benefit from their weather data as well. That is why they created an online platform for developers where they could purchase API keys and implement it in their own projects/businesses.</p>



<h4>What can you pick up from this article?</h4>



<p>Sure, not every trend is worth jumping on, but big data is no longer just a trend. This is a proven thing that works if you truly want to be able to understand your clients and transition your business to the next level.</p>



<p>Today, in order to generate more sales, you need to be able to really listen to your consumers and treasure all the data they provide you with. And with the advancements in machine learning, even smaller companies can use Big Data to improve their businesses.</p>



<p>However, with all the previously mentioned elements getting easier and more available, the influx of data sources and ways to analyze and present data has made the process of defining the right business strategy around big data that more difficult &#8211; but that is the topic for the whole new article.</p>

<h3>Subscription-based strategy is like a free trial mode as it enables users to download and try the application for free, but then requires a subscription to bypass feature or content restrictions.</h3>



<p>__________<br>If you have an app and you’re looking for a way to monetize it, our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bornfight.com/resources/business-models-for-mobile-app-monetization/" target="_blank">free ebook</a> can help you choose the right monetization model.<br>__________</p>



<p>Even though the paid subscription business model is the most common app revenue model, subscription-based mobile apps, including Netflix, Spotify, Tinder, Dropbox and Deezer have gained huge popularity in the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Mobile apps have become an integral part of everyone’s lives today, whether it’s in the area of shopping, booking, lifestyle or service in any kind. People rather prefer to book most services with mobile apps than via phone call or an email, so creating an app became a smart move for numerous companies and businesses around the world. It saves time and makes the whole process easier and more enjoyable for users.</p>



<h4>What is a subscription based app monetization model?</h4>



<p>Subscription model is similar to in-app purchases as it enables users to buy additional goods, content and features. But instead of giving them the option to buy whenever they wish, subscription model introduces ‘subscription periods’. When users have an active subscription, they can use the app’s premium aspects, and when that subscription expires, users can no longer use them &#8211; unless they subscribe again. With the subscription model, users are able to use a feature or consume content for a predetermined amount of time called a subscription period. It can be a monthly subscription or an annual one. And when that period passes, they are prompted to extend their subscription in order to get continued access to those premium features or additional content.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4679" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_04-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h5>2 main modes of subscriptions:</h5>



<ol><li><strong>Non-renewing subscriptions<br></strong>Users pay for one subscription period, and when this period ends, users are prompted to choose whether they want to buy another subscription.</li><li><strong>Automatically renewing subscriptions<br></strong>Users pay for the subscription and it automatically renews after each subscription period comes to an end.</li></ol>



<p><br>Subscription model is quickly becoming one of the top monetization options due to the fact that users get to try the application for free and that subscriptions can bring in steady recurring revenue. And in addition to that, application owners pay less transactional fees to Apple and Google for long-term subscriptions &#8211; 15%, as opposed to other models that have a strict 30% fee.</p>



<p><strong>The key to achieving success with the subscription model lies in providing users with a constant stream of fresh and valuable content and services.</strong></p>



<h5>PROS OF THE MODEL</h5>



<ul><li>Provides you with recurring revenue</li><li>Subscribers are usually loyal app users</li><li>Significantly increases app engagement</li><li>Users keep subscribing as long as they keep getting value from the app</li><li>Can attract a large number of users with a free version of the app</li><li>You can still monetize your non-subscribed users with ads</li></ul>



<h5><br>CONS OF THE MODEL</h5>



<ul><li>Can be hard to determine what to put in the free version and what behind a paywall</li><li>Paying users have extremely high expectations</li><li>Needs to be constantly updated with new, relevant and valuable content</li><li>Limits families from sharing the same app across multiple accounts and devices</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-4676" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>How to make your app worth spending for your users?</h4>



<p>If you have decided to develop a subscription-based mobile app, you need to ensure that your app includes unique features and provides useful content that is worth spending for your users.

<h3>In an ideal world, you could create a mobile application, launch it and immediately start earning money. Since the current app ecosystem isn’t an ideal world, you need a monetization strategy to take care of the money aspect.</h3>



<p>__________<br>If you have an app and you’re looking for a way to monetize it, our <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/resources/business-models-for-mobile-app-monetization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free ebook</a> can help you choose the right monetization model.<br>__________</p>



<h4>What exactly is app monetization?</h4>



<p>The short answer would be the process of leveraging an application’s user base and converting their actions and engagement into a stream of revenue. A more detailed answer would be that monetization is a specific framework that defines the exact ways in which a mobile application drives revenue and generates return on investment (ROI) &#8211; a framework that enables you to answer these questions:</p>



<ol><li>What source of income am I pursuing with the application?</li><li>What value will I be providing and at what price?</li></ol>



<p>Mobile app monetization is a way for you to earn income from your mobile application &#8211; it enables you to take luck and chance out of the picture, and take control of the aspects that affect the success of your application on the market.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5773" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>Do you need a monetization strategy?</h4>



<p>Even if you have an already existing app or you are just starting, you absolutely need a monetization strategy. You need to be able to understand how to generate money from your mobile application that would be most beneficial for your business, but also your users.</p>



<p><strong>But before you choose the monetization model for your app, here are a few steps you need to take in order to create an optimal monetization strategy.</strong></p>



<h5>#01 Consider the type of mobile app you want to create</h5>



<p>Some monetization models only work with specific types of applications, so you need to keep that in mind while you’re defining your strategy. For example, if you want your app to be premium, it needs to be superior to free alternatives, but if you’ll offer to your users the same quality app as the one from your free competitors, then maybe premium is not the way to go.</p>



<h5>#02 Understand your target persona</h5>



<p>This is a tale as old as time &#8211; but you need to know who you are making the app for.<br>If you want your product to be successful on the market, you need to know who is it for, how those customers will use it, what will make them buy it and what they want to get out of it.</p>



<h5>#03 Answers the question: ‘why would anyone buy my app’</h5>



<p>If your app is to be successful, it needs to provide users with something original, valuable or better than what the competition is currently offering &#8211; define that.</p>



<h5>#04 Define what else would your users be willing to pay for</h5>



<p>To make the income you earn grow together with your application’s user base, you need to define specific elements within the app that could be monetized. For instance, you could offer your app for free, but within the app add elements that need to be paid in order to have a better experience.</p>



<h5>#05 See what your competition is doing</h5>



<p>Researching the market you are about to enter is extremely important. And the only way to do it is by taking a look at how your competition is doing. Explore their product, their business strategies, the way they do sales, how they speak to customers &#8211; try to define what they are doing good and what they are doing bad.</p>



<h5>#06 Provide value to your users</h5>



<p>A line between providing value while maximizing revenue and being named a cash grab is thin &#8211; make sure you’re always on the right side of that line because user trust is difficult to get back. Especially now when they have many options to choose from.</p>



<h5>#07 Define your goals with the app</h5>



<p>Define your goals with the app the same way you would define goals for any other business plan. By defining specific goals you want to achieve with your mobile application, you’ll always have a guide that will keep you on the right track and help you make decisions.</p>



<h5>#08 Be in it for the long run</h5>



<p>Establishing a relationship with users is a process that takes time, but users’ engagement with the application is directly connected to revenue, so it’s worth it.</p>



<h5>#09 Don’t sacrifice user experience</h5>



<p>When choosing the right monetization model, great user experience should be one of your top priorities &#8211; great user experience means users will be more likely to spend money.</p>



<h5>#10 Keep your eye on monetization trends</h5>



<p>With more than 204 billion app downloads in 2019, monetization app trends are always changing. To be relevant, keep an eye on Google and Apple as they are major players in the app space, and their actions can have a big effect on the entire app ecosystem.</p>



<h5>#11 Don’t try to reinvent the wheel</h5>



<p>The app market is filled with examples of apps successfully using various monetization models and strategies &#8211; use those insights to your advantage.</p>



<h5>#12 Test, get feedback, iterate, repeat</h5>



<p>Just because you defined a monetization strategy that fits your app and your users, that doesn’t mean you’re done with it. Keep developing and upgrading it based on your users’ behavior.</p>

<h3>Understanding how to monetize your mobile application is a crucial aspect of app development, as it will help you earn revenue while you’re satisfying your users’ needs and providing them with great user experience.</h3>



<p>__________<br>If you have an app and you’re looking for a way to monetize it, our <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/resources/business-models-for-mobile-app-monetization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free ebook</a> can help you choose the right monetization model.<br>__________</p>



<p>Whether you’re running a large international enterprise with thousands of employees and clients, or you’re a solo developer looking to <strong>build your first app</strong>, you need to understand how to generate money from your mobile application in a way that would be most beneficial for your business, but also your users. You need to build a <strong>sustainable mobile business</strong>, and the creation of a detailed strategy that will enable your application to grow and <strong>bring income to your business</strong> is a very important step when monetizing your app. If you’re looking for a way to do it, these are the models you want to explore.</p>



<h4>#01 Premium apps</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5769" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body01.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This monetization model is pretty straightforward &#8211; if people want to use your app they must first <strong>purchase it from the app store</strong>. Once they pay for your application, they get complete access to all of its features.</p>



<p>When the app markets just started, this was the only available monetization model. Today, successfully using this model can be quite difficult as the <strong>competition from free apps is extremely high</strong> and newer monetization models are proving to be more user-friendly, as well as more lucrative for businesses.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for top of the line B2B apps that provide clear business values, as well as apps with unique features and niche audiences looking for very specific solutions.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>Users are rarely ready to buy an application they haven’t had a chance to try out first, so consider providing them with a lite version that has an implemented free trial period. After they’ve had some time to really test out the app and its features, users will have a much larger</p>



<h4>#02 In-app advertising</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5770" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body02.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In-app advertising is a monetization model in which app owners <strong>earn revenue for showing third-party ads</strong> within their mobile applications. Without this model, a lot of apps wouldn’t even exist.</p>



<p>This is one of the most popular revenue models because it can be used in almost any application. Mobile apps that use this monetization model are usually completely free for users, and app owners focus on <strong>earning their revenue from advertisers</strong>. In-app advertising model is universal, as it can be used on almost all types of mobile apps and it works for as long as an application has active users.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for all types of free apps that have the potential to be used frequently and for long periods of time.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>Although it may sound like a good idea to put as many ads as you can into your application, the truth is that you always have to put user experience first. If a specific ad type or ad frequency within the app has a negative effect on user experience, users will be less likely to use the app.</p>



<h4>#03 Freemium apps</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5771" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body03.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The word “freemium” is a combination of the words “free” and “premium”, and it perfectly explains what this monetization model exactly is &#8211; free meaning users have <strong>access to the basic functionality</strong> and premium including additional features, goods, content and other options not available in the free version.</p>



<p>Freemium is one of the more complex app monetization models as it consists of <strong>two equally important aspects</strong>. A large portion of the app’s functionalities are completely free to use (and the app itself is free to download), but if users want to unlock additional features and options, they need to pay for them.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that provide a continuous value for users &#8211; ones with a great free version and a premium version that provides unquestionable benefits.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>In order for the freemium model to work, the free version of your app needs to find the sweet spot between providing users with too many or too few features. If features in the free version of the app are too good, users won’t have the incentive to buy the full version. On the other hand, if they aren’t good enough, users won’t think the full version of the app is worth the money.</p>



<h4>#04 In-app purchases</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5772" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body04.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Despite the fact that only 5% of users make in-app purchases, revenue earned from this small percentage is almost 20 times higher than revenue earned from all the other users.</p>



<p>In-app purchases are <strong>one of the most widely used app monetization models</strong> &#8211; it revolves around the application being free, but enabling users to purchase various types of digital goods. Those goods can take many forms &#8211; from additional app features, in-game currency and power-ups to additional content, new levels, customization options and anything in between. A key component of this model is that the <strong>free aspect of the app must be fully functional</strong> &#8211; in-app purchases should serve only as enhancements to the user experience.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for games and service-based apps that are engaging enough even if users don’t spend money, as in-app purchases are used to improve the experience.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>Users like the idea of using a free application and having the option to spend money if they feel like it. You just need to make sure that every in-app purchase you incorporate into your app provides real value and boosts the overall user experience. Otherwise, your app might fall into a cash grab category and users really dislike cash grabs.</p>



<h4>#05 Subscriptions</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5773" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body05.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This strategy is like a free trial mode as it enables users to download and try the application for free, but then <strong>require a subscription</strong> to bypass feature or content restrictions.</p>



<p>Subscription model is similar to in-app purchases as it <strong>enables users to buy additional goods, content and features</strong>. But instead of giving them the option to buy whenever they wish, subscription model introduces ‘subscription periods’. When users have an active subscription, they can use app’s premium aspects, and when that subscription expires, users can no longer use them &#8211; unless they subscribe again.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that have top-quality features, are primarily service-oriented or very content-centric, and whose overall concept encourages frequent and<br>repeated usage.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>Steady, reliable revenue and the overall financial predictability of this monetization model have made both Google and Apple double down in their efforts to make subscriptions the primary monetization model. They have even decreased their commission from 30% to 15% when it comes to all subscription renewals after the first year.</p>



<h4>#06 eCommerce apps</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5774" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body06.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This model is also straightforward – <strong>your application is a marketplace</strong> through which you sell physical goods.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the eCommerce model focuses on building a mobile application that serves as your <strong>digital storefront</strong>. And more and more brands are turning to this model due to higher profit margins and the fact that app stores don’t charge a commission for selling physical goods through an app (as opposed to virtual goods that are sold as in-app purchases, and are subject to a 30% fee).</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps whose primary focus is selling physical goods to specific audiences.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>If you want to maximize user engagement, you need to leverage push notifications. As users are more likely to see a notification than open an email, you can incite them to buy more by creating a push notification strategy and sending offers specifically tailored to their needs.</p>



<h4>#07 White labeling</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5775" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body07.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you created a mobile application with unique functionality or one that solves a specific problem, you can <strong>monetize it by reskinning it for other brands</strong> or licensing your code to other companies.</p>



<p>A white label product is a term that means you are creating a product that another company can buy from you, rebrand it and sell as their own. It is a <strong>great option for earning additional revenue</strong> from that application without affecting your customers’ experience by implementing some other monetization models.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that are built on unique concepts that can be applied to multiple brands. It is also great for pulling additional revenue from apps that are at the end of their lifecycle and have stopped being profitable on their own.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>In addition to earning revenue by reskinning and reselling your entire application to other brands, you can also resell your mobile application’s code. This will enable other companies to use your application’s code as a framework that will enable them to build their own applications on it.</p>



<h4>#08 Data licencing</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5776" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body08.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If your mobile application has a large number of active users, you can start <strong>collecting information on their behavior</strong> and sell anonymous data to third parties like advertisers and analytics companies.</p>



<p>App owners have been collecting user data for ages &#8211; it showed them how their applications are being used and what aspects should they improve. But, prices that companies are willing to pay for user data are constantly rising, so a lot of app owners want to leverage that situation and <strong>generate additional app revenue</strong>. The more daily active users an app has, the more precise, relevant and valuable that data is for data collectors.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that have an extremely large and engaged user base, and can generate a significant amount of data on client preferences or habits.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>If you decide to focus on data licencing as your primary model of monetization, make sure to be mindful of different privacy laws connected to the action of selling customer data you’ve connected through the application.</p>



<h4>#09 Sponsorships</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5777" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body09.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Sponsorship revolves around brands and agencies paying to have an exclusive spot within your app. With this model, <strong>brands provide relevant rewards to your customers</strong> when they perform specific in-app activities, and you earn money by taking a share of the revenue from redeemed rewards.</p>



<p>This model is among the newest addition to app monetization as app owners looked for a way to <strong>gain revenue from advertising</strong>, but without decreasing the application’s user experience by incorporating traditional banner ads. By directly partnering with specific brands, you can not only control the type of promotional content that will be displayed within your application and make sure that it is relevant to your target group, you can also create brand activations that are more creative, engaging and interesting to your users. And that can ultimately lead to increased user loyalty.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for apps that want to provide their users with customized experiences and can partner with a brand that has a similar user base so all their activities feel like native elements of the app.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>For the sponsorship model to be effective and provide you with revenue, your mobile application’s user base needs to be either large enough or niche enough to attract brands that will want to pay to get additional exposure through the application.</p>



<h4>#10 Indirect monetization</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-1024x576.jpg?x22406" alt="" class="wp-image-5778" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bornfight_blog_grubisa_monetization_models_body10.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This monetization model is quite different from the others as it doesn’t provide direct financial benefits through the app itself. It revolves around creating a custom mobile application that takes your business models, <strong>digitizes them and provides you value</strong> by making your business more streamlined, efficient, profitable or just better overall.</p>



<p>With more and more companies embracing digital technologies as one of the primary ways to upgrade their businesses and speed up past their competition, demand for high-quality custom mobile applications that can turn traditional business processes into technologically advanced agile solutions is constantly on the rise. To have the most effect on your business, <strong>mobile applications need to be tailored to fully fit your needs</strong>. In order to do so, they can be implemented with a wide variety of customized features.</p>



<h5>IDEAL USAGE</h5>



<p>This monetization model is ideal for companies that want to digitize their business processes and have decided to leverage the benefits of mobile technology in order to do so.</p>



<h5>PRO MONETIZATION TIP</h5>



<p>If you create a mobile application to streamline, simplify or upgrade business processes within your company, try to see if your application could be turned into a Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) platform, and earn even more revenue by licencing it (or smaller, less feature-packed parts of it) to other companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>According to research, social media apps are the most used types of mobile apps, and weather apps are second. But the most interesting part is that banking apps came out as #3 on that list.</h3>



<p>Mobile banking became a standard service in the banking sector, whether it’s used for personal accounts or businesses. There are over 57 million mobile banking users in the U.S., and over 86% of U.S. banks are offering bill payments via banking apps. Providing users with <strong>total control of their financial assets</strong>, anytime and from every part of the world brought the <strong>banking experience to a completely new level</strong>. There’s no need to wait in long queues with a bunch of papers and documents to open a banking account &#8211; now we can get that with just a few clicks on any mobile device. It’s fast, easy, painless and <strong>in the palm of our hands</strong>. </p>



<p>Banking consumers are seeking an experience that is sophisticated, simple and personalized, so they can <strong>feel valued and important</strong> without live face-to-face conversations. For native mobile consumers, design, functionality, and experience can be deciding factors when they’re choosing the app that a bank or a credit union offers. Both <strong>the look and the feel of a banking app</strong> have a strong value. </p>



<p>In this blog, I gathered some of the leading banking apps and neobanks with mobile apps in the U.S. and Europe, so let&#8217;s find out <strong>how these apps stand out with their features</strong>, especially today when almost every bank has its own mobile banking app.</p>



<h4>Advanced 3D Secure Technology with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="N26 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://n26.com/" target="_blank">N26</a></h4>



<p>Every once in a while, everyone probably finds themselves digging around their pockets, old purses and jackets from the last season, looking for hidden treasures and a gold bar laying somewhere under the carpet. But we all know that’s very unlikely to happen. With <strong>N26 Spaces</strong>, there’s no need to keep those rainy day savings under the pillows. It is a tool that allows its users to <strong>set aside money and place it in a sub-account</strong> alongside their main account. Users can create as many spaces as they like and save money for birthdays, parties and long-planned trips. This way, avoiding the temptation to spend that money is easier because it&#8217;s separate from the main account, and if you can’t see it &#8211; you can’t spend it.<br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rejvsITkYQI?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>This German neobank enables its customers to open a free account directly from their smartphones, and they already have more than <strong>5 million users in over 26 countries worldwide</strong>. There are no hidden costs or foreign exchange fees, which can be very <strong>useful for travelers</strong>. N26 also implemented fingerprint identification and <strong>advanced 3D Secure technology</strong> to make its users feel extra safe and secured while purchasing &#8211; whether in-store or online. It’s also possible to have 5 free withdrawals per month and it’s easy to <strong>manage expenses</strong> as AI is used to present detailed insights into account statistics and users’ financial habits. </p>



<h4>Environmental Protection Initiatives for <a href="https://www.bunq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bunq (opens in a new tab)">Bunq</a> Users</h4>



<p>We can all agree that it should be easy for people to make a positive impact on the environment. To make that possible, <strong>Bunq</strong> recently launched its <strong>eco-friendly ‘Green Card’</strong> &#8211; a metallic card whose holders contribute to environmental preservation by having trees planted for every €100 that they spend on it. Every time the system confirms the payment, they <strong>donate a tree</strong> to the partners at Eden Reforestation Projects. All the money that is spent goes directly to provide a fair wage to local workers and plant trees in Madagascar, Nepal, Haiti, Indonesia, Mozambique and Kenya &#8211; to help heal the lungs of our planet. With this feature, Bunq unlocked a completely <strong>new set of users</strong> that are focused on the environment and reforestation. Also, they gained an <strong>eco-friendly image</strong> that is not so common in the banking sector, which made this feature one of a kind.<br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5MGm1jm8n4?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>Besides that, Bunq mobile bank offers its clients <strong>special sub-accounts for everyday budgeting</strong>. One for groceries, one for shopping, holidays or anything else they want. Each sub-account is a full bank account <strong>with its own IBAN</strong>, allowing customers to budget their direct debits, external payments and card transactions very easily. Bunq charges €0.99 per withdrawal and it’s connected with Transferwise for simple and fast money transfers.</p>



<h4>Invest in cryptocurrencies with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Revolut (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.revolut.com/" target="_blank">Revolut</a></h4>



<p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Ripple, Litecoin, Aave, Kleros… it’s hard to keep up with all the cryptocurrencies these days. Since 2009 and the first thought of Bitcoin, there were hundreds of articles prematurely declaring the end of it and doubting it could even survive till the end of the year. But, it did, and according to numerous researches, it became the <strong>top-performing asset</strong> of the decade &#8211; creating a completely new set of users for the banking sector. Since the release of Bitcoin, over <strong>6,000 altcoins</strong> (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) have been created. </p>



<p>In the fintech world, Revolut stepped up the game by presenting its users with the possibility to <strong>invest in 5 different cryptocurrencies</strong>. Any user can instantly exchange any of its 30 currencies directly into Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and XRP with just a few clicks on the phone. Also, cryptocurrencies can be sent easily to any other Revolut account.<br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMuRxmkly8A?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>Revolut Ltd is a financial technology company and a neobank. In addition to a prepaid Revolut debit card, their services include <strong>fee-free currency exchange</strong>, commission-free stock trading and cryptocurrency exchanges. It has <strong>no-fee ATM withdrawals</strong> up to £200 per month, and if anyone needs to withdraw more than that, they charge 2% of the amount. And with the interbank exchange rate, customers can <strong>transfer money abroad in 30 currencies</strong> and spend it in over 150 currencies.</p>



<h4>Talk to Erica from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bank of America Mobile App (opens in a new tab)" href="https://promo.bankofamerica.com/erica/" target="_blank">Bank of America Mobile App</a> </h4>



<p>Erica is Bank of America’s <strong>virtual financial assistant</strong> that uses <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and natural language processing to help guide customers &#8211; in its first year, she had completed more than 50 million client requests. Erica can help its users quickly find deposits, holds, purchases, refunds and credit card transactions, and with <strong>Erica Insights</strong>, it&#8217;s easy to get access to a full range of personalized, proactive insights and available guidance. </p>



<p>How many times have we all already misplaced or lost our credit card, and then started panicking because it&#8217;s the middle of the night and everything’s already closed? The most important thing to do in that case is to lock all future transactions and report it to someone, but &#8211; how to do it and who to call? This is when Erica does all the hard work &#8211; regardless of what time of the day, or night, it is.<br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lrg83riPzo?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>Also, this mobile banking uses custom alerts to track account balance and payment dues. Users can <strong>create a digital wallet</strong>, set up a budget and monitor spendings in their accounts with the <strong>Spending and Budgeting tool</strong>, and to feel extra safe, it’s also possible to protect accounts with a fingerprint sign-in on mobile devices.</p>



<h4>Stay on Schedule with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Capital One (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.capitalone.com/applications/mobile/" target="_blank">Capital One</a> Mobile App </h4>



<p>Time is the most valuable asset we own, and that’s the main reason we adore the word “instant” these days. Why waste it lost in the piles of bills and papers when it’s possible to automate all future payments and spend time with friends and family? With Capital One&#8217;s mobile app, users can set up AutoPay to have their <strong>payments made automatically each month</strong>, and use <strong>payment posting timeframes</strong> to stay on schedule. It’s pretty easy &#8211; all a user needs to do is pick a date, choose the frequency and the transfer will occur. They can transfer money weekly, every other week, twice a month, monthly or quarterly, and they can also add a memo to every transaction. <br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VdOgdWY78XI?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>Furthermore, Capital One offers a service of <strong>check deposits by simply taking a photo</strong>, and its users can send money securely to almost anyone in the United States using <strong>Zelle</strong> &#8211; a U.S.-based digital payments network for faster and easier money transactions. Plus, users can also access their accounts easily through their Apple Watch.</p>



<h4>Monitoring Investments with <a href="https://www.ally.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Ally Mobile (opens in a new tab)">Ally Mobile</a> </h4>



<p>Whether interested in tracking investments or trading stocks, Ally Bank&#8217;s mobile app offers a wide range of features to make their banking experience one of a kind. In addition to standard banking features, Ally Mobile includes <strong>numerous investing features</strong> &#8211; from trading stocks and monitoring investments to <strong>advanced charting tools for technical analysis</strong>.

<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hgTi-Oivgg?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>When using Ally Mobile&#8217;s <strong>Card Controls</strong>, it’s easy to set up and manage debit card preferences and control when, where, and how cards are used. Any user can access their account by using fingerprint or face authentication, but they can also create their own unique passcode for an even more personalized experience. </p>



<h4>Saving Money with <a href="https://www.chime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Chime (opens in a new tab)">Chime</a></h4>



<p>From time to time, saving money can feel like an uphill battle. Let’s take Vanessa as an example. Just when she thought she saved enough for that long-planned trip to Bali, her old minivan decided to break down and, poof &#8211; Bali fund just turned into New car fund. To help people like Vanessa think less about money, but saving more &#8211; Chime app can <strong>automatically take 10% of the paycheck each month</strong> and deposit that amount in the savings account. When Chime customers turn on <strong>Automatic Savings</strong>, each time their debit card is used to make a purchase, the bank rounds up the transaction amount to the nearest dollar. Then it transfers the round-up from the Spending Account to the Savings Account &#8211; the more they use their Chime Visa Debit Card, the more money is saved automatically. <br></p>


<div style="padding: 42% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_BVJjHfLEs?quality=720p&amp;color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>


<p><br>This mobile-only bank has <strong>no minimum balance, no overdraft, and no monthly service fees</strong> &#8211; and Chime users can withdraw their money from over 38,000 ATMs for free. Another special benefit is that any user can <strong>access their paychecks 2 days earlier</strong> with Chime Direct Deposit. </p>



<h4>No IBAN? No problem &#8211; use <a href="https://www.kekspay.hr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="KEKS Pay (opens in a new tab)">KEKS Pay</a> </h4>



<p>In a situation when collecting money from numerous people is necessary, KEKS Pay comes as a life-saver.

<h3>Enterprise mobility is a growing business trend that focuses on enabling employees to do their jobs from anywhere by having access to various mobile devices, applications and software solutions.</h3>



<p>With mobile devices becoming more and more powerful with every new generation, a large number of businesses are starting to provide their employees with mobile solutions that are able to partially or completely substitute the traditional ways of doing their job and the standard tools they used, but also to upgrade the business processes within your company. </p>



<p>This shift is called enterprise mobility and, due to its numerous benefits for both companies and employees, it is quickly becoming a core aspect in business strategies of companies that are focused on long-term growth and continuous improvement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01.jpg?x22406" alt="Enterprise mobility - people using a smartphone and a tablet - iPhone and an iPad" class="wp-image-4676" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>Key aspects of enterprise mobility</h4>



<p>When it comes to the implementation of enterprise mobility into a business strategy, there are 4 core pillars it stands upon.</p>



<h5>1. Company stakeholder’s willingness to accept enterprise mobility</h5>



<p>This is the basis for all the other pillars &#8211; ensuring that key stakeholders from a company understand what enterprise mobility is all about and the changes it brings, as well as the benefits a company can reap (we’ll talk about them in the next section) by implementing it into their business strategy. </p>



<p>As the implementation process should not be considered a one and done kind of thing, but an important part of company’s growth that needs to tie in closely with their overall strategy, it is imperative that people making key decisions are aligned and that their <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/why-setting-the-right-expectations-matters-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="expectations are clearly defined (opens in a new tab)">expectations are clearly defined</a>.</p>



<h5>2. Defining processes that can be enhanced through the use of mobile tech</h5>



<p>When key stakeholders are aligned and when they understand the benefits the company can get by implementing enterprise mobility, it is time to analyze the company and define the process or processes that should be upgraded with mobile technology. The easiest way to perform this process of analysis and definition is <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/product-discovery-workshop-top-5-benefits-for-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="product discovery (opens in a new tab)">product discovery</a> &#8211; an organized set of activities that involve all stakeholders and helps them dig deep into the business.</p>



<p>The output of this product discovery process is a detailed list of business processes that are primed for mobile implementation, as well as a fully fleshed out mobile solution that should be developed.</p>



<h5>3. Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets</h5>



<p>As the entire premise of enterprise mobility lies upon enabling employees to do their jobs from anywhere, mobile devices that are powerful enough to substitute traditional tools are a key component of implementation. As modern mobile devices can be used to perform a wide variety of different tasks without a problem, when it comes to implementation of enterprise mobility, choosing the right device for the job usually ends up as deciding on the look and feel (something premium like Apple’s iPad or something more affordable) and defining the right specs that will fit the application’s functionalities, as well as choosing between a smartphone and a tablet, and then picking one made from a manufacturer of your choice. </p>



<h5>4. Custom mobile application or a mobile software suite</h5>



<p>The final and arguably the most important element of enterprise mobility is software your employees will be using to perform their jobs. This <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/services/mobile-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="mobile application (opens in a new tab)">mobile application</a> or an entire software suite of mobile tools should be powerful enough to substitute the traditional tools employees used, but also to enhance those business processes defined in the second pillar.</p>



<p>One of the most common ways of implementing enterprise mobility solutions into a company is to create a custom mobile application with a set of <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/choosing-the-right-features-for-your-custom-mobile-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="features that are specifically tailored (opens in a new tab)">features that are specifically tailored</a> to a company&#8217;s business processes &#8211; in a way that complements or substitutes them, and makes them simpler and more efficient.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_02.jpg?x22406" alt="Enterprise mobility - person using a mobile phone at a meetup" class="wp-image-4677" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_02-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>What can your company get by embracing enterprise mobility</h4>



<p>There are a number of very clear and direct benefits your company can gain by implementing and taking advantage of enterprise mobility and all of its aspects.</p>



<h5>Increased productivity</h5>



<p>The sheer fact that your employees can use mobile solutions to work from any place and manage their work environment means their overall productivity is very likely to increase.</p>



<h5>Better communication</h5>



<p><a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/improve-your-internal-business-processes-with-custom-mobile-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Custom mobile applications for businesses (opens in a new tab)">Custom mobile applications for businesses</a> can feature a wide variety of communication tools within them, which provide a real-time connection to your central management system and other tools you use, as well as other team members.</p>



<h5>Higher efficiency </h5>



<p>Mobile devices and mobile applications can provide your employees with all of the information they need to successfully do their jobs. There are no more lost papers or misplaced folders &#8211; everything your employees need is at every moment just a few taps or clicks away.</p>



<h5>Streamlined workflow</h5>



<p>By connecting the mobile application to your central management or sales or ordering or any other kind of system, and providing a direct link between it and employees’ mobile devices, you make your processes much faster and easier to perform.</p>



<h5>Better user experience and higher user satisfaction</h5>



<p>Enterprise mobility solutions enable your employees to provide real-time assistance to your customers. The faster you can help your customers, the higher their satisfaction will be, and the higher will be the chance of them buying your product or using your services.</p>



<h5>Increased security and data control</h5>



<p>As mobile solutions can come with advanced security options that can prevent unauthorized access and guard from various types of attacks, you can be certain that your company information is safe. They also give you remote access to connected mobile devices, which enables you to lock devices and erase data in case the device itself gets lost, stolen or in any way compromised.</p>



<h4>And the employees</h4>



<p>Enterprise mobility can have a positive effect on your employees’ work-life balance as it offers them more flexibility and choice when it comes to doing their job. And that can lead to higher employee satisfaction and decreased employee turnover. Some employees also have a higher rate of productivity when they work from home or a place other than the office &#8211; and enterprise mobility gives them a chance to better manage their work environment.</p>



<p>Also, depending on the features and functionalities of mobile solution that is implemented, enterprise mobility can empower your employees by providing them with a platform through which they can express their ideas and talk to other members of the company about important company-related topics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_03.jpg?x22406" alt="Enterprise mobility - person in front of a TV screen that depicts mobile applications" class="wp-image-4678" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_03.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_03-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bornfight_blog_dorian_enterprise_mobility_body_03-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure>



<h4>‘That wouldn’t work in my industry’ </h4>



<p>While, at first, some types of companies and industries might seem like a more logical fit for enterprise mobility, the truth is that almost any company can find a process or a specific type of work done by their employees, that can be made more efficient by incorporating an enterprise mobility approach and augmenting employees with mobile solutions. Yes, companies in the IT sector that have started to embrace the notion of remote work almost to the point of having no office spaces at all &#8211; they are the prime candidates for (and users of) enterprise mobility solutions. But the fact is that most companies have at least one process that could greatly benefit from a mobile application.</p>



<p><strong>Some of the clearest examples of processes that can be made more efficient through the use of enterprise mobility solutions are:</strong></p>



<ol><li>internal communication among employees</li><li>onboarding employees</li><li>different types of sales and ordering processes</li><li>empowering field force teams</li></ol>



<p>Internal communication and onboarding on their own, especially within larger companies, can be very complex and can lead to employees missing critical information or not being included in the loop whatsoever. Couple that with traditional communication and onboarding tools like emails, messengers, task managers or surveys that aren’t customized for your business &#8211; things can get out of hand quite rapidly. On the other hand, a custom mobile application, for example in the form of a <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/work/beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="private social network (opens in a new tab)">private social network</a>, can be tailored to your exact needs and the process you want to build within your company. Through it, you can precisely specify how communication channels within your company work and what onboarding aspects should each new employee go through, and you can ultimately make sure that all of the employees are receiving the information they need in order to successfully do their jobs.</p>



<p>As for sales and empowering your field force &#8211; just think of having a team of sales reps armed with nothing more than tablets and mobile applications. Instead of calling potential prospects from the office, they can be in the field talking directly to customers and showing them how your products work instead of explaining it. Add to that the fact that the mobile app on the tablet is directly connected to your central system that handles orders and sales, and can process a deal in an instant &#8211; and you have quite a big upgrade on a traditional sales process.</p>

<h4>How to start implementing enterprise mobility</h4>



<p>The first step to implementing enterprise mobility into your company is to analyze your business processes and define the ones that would benefit the most from enterprise mobility. As enterprise mobile applications are starting to become more and more prevalent in modern and progressive businesses, you too should see how your company might embrace one and reap the benefits of enterprise mobility. </p>



<p>If you need assistance in defining business processes mentioned above, as well as the exact type of a mobile application your company might use, we suggest you conduct <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/benefits-of-a-product-discovery-workshop-and-why-do-you-need-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="product discovery (opens in a new tab)">product discovery</a>. It is a process during which key stakeholders from your company and a set of our experts go through a series of workshops and structured activities &#8211; they dig deep into your business, analyze it and help you define the right mobile solution for your company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>WebCamp is one of the most popular non-profit community-organised conferences for developers in Croatia.</h3>
<p>The first WebCamp conference was organized all the way back in 2012, and it quickly became one of the most visited regional conferences. It&#8217;s organized by a variety of local development communities, like PHP, JS, Ruby, Golang, Rust and many others.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s conference was extremely exciting as the topics weren&#8217;t exclusively focused on technology and development, but also included a variety of topics that talked about soft skills and some more &#8216;philosophical&#8217; aspects of development. All in all, it was one of the better conferences I attended this year both in terms of organization and the amount of new things I got to hear and learn.</p>
<p><strong>But let&#8217;s not beat around the bush anymore. Let&#8217;s jump right into the talks!</strong></p>
<h4>Some of the best talks on the WebCamp agenda</h4>
<h5>The top work skills you need in the 21st century by Merlin Rebrović</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4287" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="WebCamp 2019 talk by Merlin Rebrovic - Bornfight Blog" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>In his talk, Merlin Rebrović explained how we live in a world where requirements for jobs we do and skills needed to do these jobs are constantly changing. Some of the jobs didn’t even exist until yesterday, and we can’t actually predict or tell for sure what kind of jobs we will do in the future. This human progress is beneficial for humanity, but it can be overwhelming for an individual &#8211; especially when it comes to determining which skills should we learn considering the demands and our own limited resources.</p>
<p>But, although a lot of needed skills are changing, there are some underlying skills that will be needed for the future. And if we want to relieve some of the stress and anxiety caused by having to choose between all of the available skills, we should focus on these more universal skills.</p>
<p><strong>So what are those universal skills? Merlin says: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Critical thinking</li>
<li>Collaboration.</li>
</ol>
<p>Merlin also talked about this topic at the last Digital Lab.in conference, and you can see it in the video below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>The 737 MAX — Human Factors in Complex Systems by Kyle Kotowick</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4288" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="WebCamp 2019 talk by Kyle Kotowick - Bornfight Blog" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>During his talk, Kyle told a very interesting story of the Boeing 737 crashes. The story was very well carried out with a clear timeline and clear cause and effects from an objective point of view &#8211; referencing the The Seattle Times articles and excerpts.</p>
<p>He later connected this story to the main point of his talk and explained the importance of fail-safe mechanisms and life-critical systems such as aeronomy, telecommunication, public services, automotive, health care and military. This was one of those talks that took us beyond the process of coding and showed us why double and triple-checking needs to be a core element of everything we do as developers.</p>
<h5>Leadership lessons from building a remote team by Evelin Andrespok</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4289" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="WebCamp 2019 talk by Evelin Andrespok - Bornfight Blog" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body03.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Demand for remote work has exponentially grown in last couple of years, especially in our industry. That is why Evelin shared some of the experiences and insights she gained in a company that went full remote 5 years ago.</p>
<p>Her talk was very interesting because, in addition to talking about pros and cons of remote work, she also covered a variety of topics that are also extremely important, like isolation, productiveness and practicality, as well as how remote requires more communication and how, in the end, remote work is still work.</p>
<p>She also put all of this into a much larger perspective. Think about this &#8211; if you go to work when everybody else goes to work, you&#8217;ll also go to the groceries shop when everyone else does, you&#8217;ll go to gym when everyone else does&#8230; And this affects your quality of life and makes you and the entire society less efficient.</p>
<p>Our industry is one where remote work could and should work and she claimed that remote work is a future skill that will be extremely desirable from both the employer&#8217;s and the employee&#8217;s point of view.</p>
<h5>Raising $24 million to Build an Open Source Skynet by Tal Ater</h5>
<p>Quick public service announcement before we start &#8211; no need to panic, they aren&#8217;t really building Skynet. I hope. But just in case someone out there is, I just want it to make it clear that I, for one, welcome our robotic overlords. Now that I&#8217;m safe, let&#8217;s get back to the talk.</p>
<p>Tal is focused on standardizing transport in general and works for DAV — a blockchain-based transportation protocol that enables a decentralised, peer-to-peer global transportation network. It is a very disrupting niche which will affect our lives in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>In his talk, Tal explained the difference between driverless and autonomous and then shared an interesting story about how driverless drones can now deliver goods to your doorstep, but they have a very limited reach. The goal is to make these drones autonomous, and enable them to go to publicly available drone charging stations, pay for the charging time and continue with their jobs.</p>
<p>With this, the future will be extremely interesting. Just please don&#8217;t create Skynet!</p>
<h5>Conducting Humane Code Reviews by Adrienne Tacke</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4301" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body04-1.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body04-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body04-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body04-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body04-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Code reviews are a very important event and the main goal of them is to ensure better quality of the code itself. In her talk, Adrienne mentioned two essential elements of code review:</p>
<ol>
<li>For someone who wrote the code, the learning part is essential</li>
<li>For someone who is conducting the code review, the key is to transfer the experience and knowledge in an educational manner</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Adrienne, code reviews can be events where a lot of friction can happen between team members because of ego, pride, embarrassment etc. To tackle that issue, she shared with us some examples of what bad code reviews look like and what good code reviews look like. The main thing we need to keep in mind is that the communication is the key element between good and bad.</p>
<p><strong>Key message from her talk -&gt; &#8220;suggest with facts, reject with courtesy, clarify with an open mind&#8221;.</strong></p>
<h5>From Conversation to Software by Pim Elshoff</h5>
<p>The essence of this talk, as Pim said, is dismantling stories through conversation. Pim told us a little anecdote from his own experience &#8211; it was a story about a feature that was not so simple to create. It took 2 weeks to finish and, in the end, the feature was never used by the client. Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>The point of his story and his entire talk was to always check who the stakeholder is (before asking all the other questions). Who will be using the product, what do they expect from it and how it needs to work &#8211; that is the key. Everything else is just nice to have &#8211; just like that feature from the beginning of his story.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s one clear advice I remembered from the talk -&gt; &#8220;pick the solutions that fit the budget and constantly have conversation with clients&#8221;.</strong></p>
<h4>WebCamp Zagreb 2019 statistics</h4>
<p>On of the most interesting additions to the conference was the F5, also known as refresh &#8211; craft beer that was specifically brewed for this conference. It was a great touch and all of the devs enjoyed it &#8211; we all drank around 350L of it, so you know it was good.</p>

Nadamo se da je svima F5 odgovarao (pogotovo frontend developerima <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) i hvala organizatorima na ukazanoj prilici da radimo konferencijsko pivo!! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wczg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#wczg</a> <a href="https://t.co/2eWBjjEiYV">pic.twitter.com/2eWBjjEiYV</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In addition to beer, the organizers prepared a bunch of other stats just like the previous years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4292" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body06.jpg?x22406" alt="WebCamp 2019 statistics - Bornfight Blog" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body06.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body06-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bornfight_blog_jurisic_webcamp_body06-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Quite an awesome achievement if I may say.</p>
<h4>So, What did I think about it?</h4>
<p>All in all, it was great. There were a bunch of talks, a bunch of workshops, there was even an &#8220;unconference&#8221; part of the conference that was very interesting as visitors themselves had a chance to organize an entire separate track of talks with anything they wanted to learn more about.</p>
<p>I have to say that the organization keeps going up a notch with every year, so I&#8217;m not even surprised that the conference is gaining more and more popularity &#8211; even in countries outside the region.</p>
<p><strong>Well, now that we&#8217;ve reached the end of this blog, all I can say is &#8211; hope to see you all at WebCamp Zagreb 2020!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>In this edition of Digging Deeper, we sat down with Dženita, our Project Manager. Here&#8217;s what she told us about the process behind creating 33 interactive installations for the Abdullah Al-Salem Cultural Centre in Kuwait, one of the world&#8217;s largest museums.</h3>
<h4>Let&#8217;s start with a fairly direct question. A large number of different companies and agencies worked on this project. Tell me how was the project initially set up&#8230;</h4>
<p>Well, the <a href="https://ascc.bornfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Cultural Centre project</a> was extremely large, so we, at first, weren&#8217;t even exactly sure how the entire thing had been set up or how many companies were involved. At that initial point, we only worked with and were in direct communication with the Kingdom X agency &#8211; and they were the ones communicating with other agencies on the project. They were our primary point of contact with the client, as well as the companies that provided the hardware components for the applications we had to design and develop.</p>
<p>As for our side of the project, we started with a pretty straightforward process &#8211; we get the client&#8217;s brief for an application, we analyze it and then it goes to our production teams. When they finish their parts, we send them to the client, go through a couple of rounds of feedback and iterations to perfect the solution and then we&#8217;re off to the next stage of the process. As it happened, on a project of this scope where everything needs to go through a couple of levels of approval, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to create any kind of strict plan. One of the most difficult aspects was receiving feedback as sometimes it arrived in an instant and sometimes we had to wait a couple of weeks. At that initial phase, we were constantly reacting to things that were happening &#8211; that is why we had to change our approach and fully focus on flexibility in order to maximize our output, as well as the quality of created solutions.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3661" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body05.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body05.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body05-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>Got it. How was this feedback process organized?</h4>
<p>There were a couple of levels. After a part of the application had been finished, we sent that to Kingdom X, who then sent us a first round of feedback &#8211; this part usually passed in no time. After that initial feedback, the iterated version was sent to the Cultural Innovations, who were one of the few top-level companies on the project that made sure everything was aligned across the entire project and across all agencies &#8211; from single elements to the styleguide and everything in between. Then you receive feedback from them &#8211; you iterate the solution and when everything is OK, then it goes to the client. When the part you created reaches the client, then you get the last round of feedback. As you can see, this was a fairly complex process that took quite a bit of time and can&#8217;t be strictly planned. Multiply that 33 times, because we needed to create 33 applications for the museum, and you get why we needed to be flexible with our process and plans.</p>
<h4>Bornfight had to create 33 applications for the museum. I suppose you haven&#8217;t worked on all of them simultaneously. Did you split them into smaller groups?</h4>
<p>To make the entire process more fluid, we actually split the applications into four batches with a maximum of 10 apps in each. The apps in each of the batches were placed according to their complexity &#8211; we wanted to level the difficulty across the board, so we had, for example, 5 easy apps, 3 medium apps and 1 difficult in a single batch. This way, we could focus on quality while still making sure we&#8217;re doing everything on time.</p>
<h4>Could you choose which application would go into a certain batch, or was that something the client did?</h4>
<p>Yeah, we grouped the applications into batches ourselves &#8211; we used the briefs we got from the client to define their complexity and then placed them into one of the four batches I mentioned. Of course, we had to do some swapping during the course of the project, but nothing really major.</p>
<p>Actually, the entire process got more streamlined when we were put into direct contact with Cultural Innovation &#8211; that top-level company I mentioned earlier. This is when we started getting more involved in the project at large, when we started meeting the decision-makers on the project and when we had more opportunity to defend our ideas face-to-face.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3665" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>So there were 33 applications in four batches. Can you take one of the apps and explain the entire process &#8211; from the first brief to it actually being installed in the museum?</h4>
<p>OK, every application started with a brief. In it, we got a detailed description of what the app itself should do. The really specific part about this project was that every application needed to be educational &#8211; that&#8217;s why every brief had a bunch of educational, expert-level content. We mostly worked on applications about prehistoric life, nature and our impact on the environment, so all the briefs came with a basic overview of how the app should function and that overview was supported by large quantities of additional material that provided the scientific background.</p>
<p>As the applications also needed to be fun and interactive, as well as educational, we had to find a way to actually merge these to opposites and find a solution that would be appealing to users, while at the same time providing them with enough knowledge about the topic that a specific app needed to cover. This initial analysis of the app briefs took us a while as we needed to define client expectations, but also provide them with argumentation on how we should actually structure specific apps, so users would actually want to use them again and again.</p>
<p>When this part was done, we moved onto defining the flow path for the application &#8211; we needed to show what content will be presented on each screen of the application and how it all tied in together. That was also the aspect of production where we started defining specific gamification elements for each of the applications.</p>
<h4>Let me stop you for a second. You had very detailed briefs, but when it came to specific elements and style of the application &#8211; were they strictly defined or did you have some creative freedom?</h4>
<p>Well, that was kind of a mixed bag. We had quite a bit of freedom to propose different elements that would upgrade the overall appearance and functionalities of the apps we were creating, but at the same time, the client had a very clear picture of what they wanted to get, so it was mostly the process of finding the solution that maximizes both sides. This flow path and gamification aspects I mentioned were one of those elements where we had creative freedom.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s get back to what I was saying &#8211; after the flow was done and approved, it was time to start with the design aspect of the application where we actually put some life into those bare wireframes. When it comes to design, we had quite a bit of challenges &#8211; you see, a large number of applications we worked on were about the prehistoric era, and the amount of assets that present that period are quite limited or even non-existent. Getting those assets used to take quite a bit of time, so we were in a constant state of shifting from work mode to stand-by mode while we waited for other agencies and companies involved in the project to acquire or produce the materials we needed to continue. But as the project continued, those issues happened less and less as all of the involved companies started getting the hang of the entire project.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3664" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body03.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body03-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body03-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body03-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>Now that you mentioned issues. What would you say was the most challenging aspect of this project?</h4>
<p>One of the biggest challenges we all faced was the overall communication between different agencies, companies and decision-makers that were involved in this project. It seems like a basic prerequisite, but communication was very limited. I believe that the entire project would have been much more streamlined if we all found a way to directly communicate with each other right from the start &#8211; I&#8217;m aware that kind of thing is difficult to organize on a project of this scale, but we all saw the massive boost this project received when we opened communication lines in the later stages of the project.</p>
<h4>When the time came to actually install all those applications inside the museum&#8230; tell me what was that like?</h4>
<p>This was a very interesting aspect of the project. We spent 4 weeks in Kuwait &#8211; we went there 2 times and stayed for 2 weeks. The first time we got there, the museum was still under construction &#8211; we had to wear hard hats and construction equipment. We kind of expected for the installation to be plug-and-play, so this took a bit by surprise, but we quickly figured out a way to navigate through all of this and install our apps. The great thing was that we met the guys from the Atlas hardware company when we got there, and then we worked together to set up as much installations as possible during the time we were there. In those first two weeks, we actually managed to fully set up 12 installations. And when we got there the second time, we managed to install everything else. I have to say it was all very interesting &#8211; challenging and sometimes unexpected, but very interesting.</p>
<h4>When you were in Kuwait, what was the communication like with the team back here in our Zagreb HQ? I suppose you needed their support&#8230;</h4>
<p>Our entire team was extremely dedicated to the project. I mean, this was one of the most amazing projects we ever worked on, so everyone was extremely motivated to deliver the best solutions that we can. When we were in Kuwait installing the apps, I would contact the crew back home once a day with plans for the following day &#8211; either some changes we needed to implement or new builds that needed to be pushed out. And everyone, from the design team to QA &#8211; everyone was ready to assist us with whatever they could. You see, there were 5 of us who went to Kuwait, and I&#8217;m certain that we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to install all of the apps without the support from the team back home. I&#8217;m really proud of the entire team.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3662" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body02.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>Let&#8217;s talk about all our teams that worked on the project. Who was involved, how many people&#8230;</h4>
<p>For the most part, we had 17 people who were fully committed to the project &#8211; that&#8217;s that middle of the project part where every batch of applications were in one production phase or the other. That&#8217;s when we really needed all hands on deck as we worked on multiple applications simultaneously &#8211; some were in the planning phase, some in design phase, some in development phase, and some in finalization phase.</p>
<p>As for people, we had 6 designers, 6 front-end developers and 4 back-end developers. And I handled it all from the project management side. The entire project was front-heavy, that&#8217;s why we had a large number of designers and front-end developers. Back-end part focused mostly on handling the setup for apps that needed to connect with custom hardware.</p>
<h4>This was one of the first projects where we actually formed strict project teams. What would you say were some of the pros and cons of that type of setup?</h4>
<p>Well, I really believe the results are much better when a team is fully committed to one project because you can really dig deep into the project and everything moves much faster. I mean, if we&#8217;re talking about some simpler, smaller, shorter projects, the benefits are not as evident, but when we&#8217;re talking about a complex, year-long project, it&#8217;s most certainly a good thing to have a dedicated team.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of having dedicated teams is that people can lose motivation if they have to work on one single thing for a very long time, and that&#8217;s something we had to find a solution to during this project, but the synergy between the members of the team that gets created because of the project is truly unmatched. When you see just how motivated and inspired other members are, you too get that much needed boost that pushes you to give your max.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3663" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body04.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body04.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bornfight_blog_dorian_digging_deeper_jenny_kuwait_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h4>And what about the project management side of it? I mean, you handled this large project all by yourself&#8230;</h4>
<p>From the project management side, the best part about working on a large project such as this one is the ability to create your own process, your own flow just for this one project. Every member of the team gets into this sort of a zone, you know exactly what others are thinking, what they&#8217;re feeling, how they&#8217;ll handle their tasks and this makes the entire project management aspect much simpler and more streamlined. Like I said, you get into that flow and this extremely complex project becomes simpler.</p>
<p>You see, when we started, we actually planned to have 3 dedicated project managers for this one project, but we quickly found out there&#8217;s too much different info going on around that everyone involved needed to know. The problem was, that info wasn&#8217;t reaching everyone because we were split into three parts. That&#8217;s when we decided to switch it up and focus everything around one project manager &#8211; one point of contact and communication that would have the full overview over the entire project.</p>
<p>I have to say that it was really challenging &#8211; it was a lot of apps, a lot of people, a lot of information and very clear deadlines I needed to handle. So yeah, I felt the pressure, but that&#8217;s why I focused on the people in the team, and making sure they&#8217;re always fully motivated and inspired. I knew that if they&#8217;re fully committed to make all of this work, my part would be simpler. Yeah, this was one of the most exciting projects we ever worked on, and that drives you to push further even when it gets tough, but you always need that extra pat on the back.</p>
<h4>Last question. When you finally saw all the apps installed and set up at the museum &#8211; can you describe the feeling?</h4>
<p>Amazing, it&#8217;s just an amazing feeling. I mean, when we installed our first application and saw it work just as we planned, we just started celebrating. But when you see all the interactive installations inside that gigantic museum, all the additional elements, that majestic environment that was created &#8211; it&#8217;s just out of this world.</p>
<p>When you see the apps themselves on a screen when you&#8217;re developing them, you can see they&#8217;ll be fun and entertaining, but when you see it all connected in that space, that&#8217;a completely different story. Much more amazing that anything else!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Conducting a discovery workshop before any production starts will enable our clients to improve their ideas and get the products to the market much faster.</h3>
<p>A product discovery workshop is a part of the initial definition and planning phase of <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating a digital product</a>. When we say digital product, we primarily mean custom software, mobile applications, web applications and interactive installations, but the definition can be stretched out to include even more types of digital solutions.</p>
<p>In a couple of years that we have been actively organizing and conducting <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/benefits-of-a-product-discovery-workshop-and-why-do-you-need-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product discovery workshops</a> for our clients, we noticed a number of different benefits both for us as a development company, but also for our clients. Here are 5 main benefits of product discovery workshops that our clients usually single out as most important.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3466" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body01.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="3000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body01.jpg 3000w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body01-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body01-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body01-1024x512.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></p>
<h4>Benefit #1: the overall product idea will be improved and upgraded</h4>
<p>The first thing our clients notice when we start with a product discovery workshop is that we have a fully dedicated team of industry experts who will be completely involved in their project. That team includes designers, developers and business strategists who have <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/product-discovery-workshop-filling-out-a-pre-discovery-questionnaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fully researched our client’s company</a>, potential benchmarks, competition and market opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Bornfight sent a two-person team to visit our office and used that time to learn about our business. We then visited their office for a week to scope out the work. For the first time, our platform is intuitive and enables users to onboard quickly.&#8221; &#8211; Mutiu Fagbayi / CEO of Performance Fact Inc.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, our goal is not just to define the elements of the product we should create, but also maximize its chance of succeeding on the market. Sometimes it means increasing the scope of the project, sometimes it’s all about focusing on a single thing and sometimes the key is to completely shift the perspective. Regardless of the strategy we end up taking, we always approach this part by clearly defining target users &#8211; personas who will be using the final product when it launches and hits the market. This is a crucial element because by knowing who’ll use our client’s digital product, as well as <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/why-setting-the-right-expectations-matters-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their expectations from it</a>, we can actually structure and define all the other features, functionalities and core elements of the project &#8211; we can fully tailor the final product to match those users’ needs.</p>
<p>By putting our top experts to work together with our clients on defining user personas and those core elements of the project, we ensure that we’ll find that one ideal solution for the problem our client is trying to solve, define its key elements and see that it hits the market.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3469" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body02.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="3000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body02.jpg 3000w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body02-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body02-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body02-1024x512.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></p>
<h4>Benefit #2: general production costs will likely decrease</h4>
<p>The number and the overall complexity of features and functionalities are the aspects that can greatly affect the production costs of a single product. When clients approach us with their ideas, we’re usually looking at one of these two scenarios &#8211; they only have their idea and want us to help them define everything else, or they come with large lists of features they would like to implement into their digital product. This second scenario is where we can most clearly feel this decrease in production costs, because we can usually split features on those lists into three groups &#8211; crucial, nice to have and unnecessary. And it’s the product discovery workshop that actually shows us which feature goes into which group.</p>
<p>Sometimes <a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/why-discovery-workshops-save-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clients think they need a specific feature</a> to make their product work, sometimes they think they need one type of product while they actually need something else and sometimes they don’t know there’s a simpler way to create the product they need. Whatever the case may be, product discovery workshops will show exactly what our clients want to accomplish, what problem do they want to solve and how should the solution be structured.</p>
<p>This is also one of the key benefits we present to them when they ask why do they need discovery workshops in the first place. The answer &#8211; we show them a couple of clients we worked with where the initial project estimate was 30% to 50% larger than the final estimate we gave them after the workshop.</p>
<h4>Benefit #3: time needed to create the product will decrease</h4>
<p>This benefit ties in closely with the previous one, and the reasoning behind it is extremely simple. A fully defined structure of the product with a clear list of elements and features that need to be created and implemented is the crucial aspect that enables our team to define a detailed estimate of the time that will be needed to produce the entire product.</p>
<p>This estimate then helps us create an entire production timeline, all the way from the first meeting until the product is launched and on the market. The timeline we create shows when our team will work on which part of the project, what needs to happen before we move to the next section and what comes after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Bornfight is incredibly responsive. They stick to our timelines and are always available whenever we have questions or concerns. Their team went above and beyond in understanding our brand and providing excellent service.&#8221; &#8211; Erin Falter / Marketing Director at WOLACO</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A combination of all these elements enables us to maximize efficiency by minimizing downtime or idling, and that ultimately results in our clients having their product launched sooner than it would have launched if we didn’t start with a product discovery workshop.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3468" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body03.jpg?x22406" alt="" width="3000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body03.jpg 3000w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body03-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body03-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bornfight_blog_dorian_discovery_workshop_client_body03-1024x512.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></p>
<h4>Benefit #4: chance to encounter problems will be minimized</h4>
<p>Modifying ideas and handling issues is much simpler and cheaper for our clients if it happens before any production begins, than it is when we’re heavy in design or development phases. That’s why we want to avoid any surprises that might occur and why we’re extremely detailed when it comes to defining potential problems. That is also why we see the process of analyzing and defining pain points and potential issues within our client’s idea as one of the key elements of every product discovery workshop.</p>
<p><strong>During the product discovery workshop, we analyze both the business aspect and the production aspect of our client’s idea, and we do it to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Resolve or evade any and all potential problems early on</li>
<li>Minimize the chance to encounter anything unexpected during production</li>
<li>Ensure everything is within budget and going according to the timeline</li>
<li>Make sure the idea is market-ready and maximize its chance of success</li>
</ol>
<p>You see, as our clients’ ideas are usually not completely defined right from the start, we use the discovery workshop to define them, and that results in a much more streamlined production process both for our clients and for our team since we all know exactly what to expect during each phase.</p>
<h4>Benefit #5: client will receive a fleshed-out production plan</h4>
<p>The last benefit our clients single out is the project blueprint. The blueprint is actually a detailed production plan &#8211; a document we prepare for our clients after the workshop is done. It’s a detailed overview of the entire project that includes everything we defined during the product discovery workshop and additional elements that describe how the project should be handled and developed. Some of the key components it consists of is the explanation of the overall idea, business strategies, design elements, technologies that should be used, answers to all issues and detailed solutions for every single aspect of the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;We were all very impressed with what the development and design teams came up with. They’re also flexible in working with limited budgets, and they’re able to create a campaign that keeps our end goal and key performance indicators in mind.&#8221; &#8211; Chloe Ravat / Marketing Manager at Lufthansa</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Based on the type of the project, the blueprint comes with some of these elements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product vision</li>
<li>Product purpose</li>
<li>Main goals the product needs to achieve</li>
<li>Defined primary target users</li>
<li>Defined secondary target users</li>
<li>Detailed user flows</li>
<li>Defined proto personas</li>
<li>Detailed user scenarios</li>
<li>Low fidelity wireframes (page element lists)</li>
<li>Sitemap</li>
<li>Design style moodboard</li>
<li>Functional requirements &amp; tech stack</li>
<li>MVP definition</li>
<li>Project roadmap</li>
<li>Product development strategy (build strategy)</li>
<li>Prioritized features</li>
</ul>
<p>As we always like to say, this blueprint is so detailed that it enables our clients to go to any development company, show them the document and they’ll know exactly what they need to create and how to do it in the most efficient way.</p>
